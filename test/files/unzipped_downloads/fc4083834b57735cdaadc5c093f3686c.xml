MONROE — Bail has been denied for a man who was arrested and accused of using a golf club to rob another man and then leading authorities on a high-speed vehicle chase in Monroe Township early today. 
During his arraignment today in First District Court, Avery Taylor, 19, of New Boston, Mich., was ordered held without bail in the Monroe County jail pending his next court appearance, according to the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office. There were no reported injuries in the incident, deputies said. 
Sheriff deputies responding to a call of an armed robbery arrived about 12:45 a.m. today and met the victim in the parking lot of the Wendy’s Restaurant at 876 South Monroe St, according to a written statement released by the sheriff’s office. The victim told deputies he was sitting in his vehicle in the parking lot when a man with a bandanna covering his face approached him and broke out the driver’s side window with a golf club. 
The assailant then demanded money. Once the victim gave him his wallet, the other man ran with it through the parking lot to his vehicle and then drove south on Monroe Street, at a high rate of speed. 
A short time later, a sheriff deputy spotted the vehicle southbound on South Dixie Highway, stopped it, and identified the suspect who was still wearing the bandanna used in the robbery. 
The wallet and its contents were later recovered where the suspect had thrown it from his vehicle just before he was stopped.

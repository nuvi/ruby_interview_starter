The Latest on the investigation into the death of Prince (all times local): 
5:45 p.m. 
Investigators in Minnesota are revisiting Prince&apos;s Paisley Park estate more than two weeks after the star&apos;s death. 
A Carver County sheriff&apos;s vehicle entered through the gates of Paisley park Tuesday afternoon, followed by about a dozen unmarked vehicles. Officials at the scene would not respond to questions about what they were doing there. Carver County Sheriff&apos;s Chief Deputy Jason Kamerud told The Associated Press by phone that investigators are &quot;being thorough.&quot; 
A man wearing a sheriff&apos;s department badge got out of an unmarked vehicles and yelled, &quot;Open the gates!&quot; to the private security company inside. The vehicles then moved through the gates and went around to the door of Paisley Park. A siren briefly sounded, and then the cars disappeared from view. 
Authorities revisited the scene amid news of a search warrant that shows investigators have interviewed a Minnesota doctor who treated Prince twice the month he died.

A search warrant reveals that a Minnesota doctor saw Prince twice in the month before his death, including the day before he died, and prescribed him medication. 
The warrant was filed Thursday in Hennepin County. It was obtained by KSTP-TV and the Los Angeles Times. It says Dr. Michael Todd Schulenberg treated Prince on April 7 and April 20, and that he prescribed &quot;medications and prescriptions&quot; for the musician. 
Investigators interviewed Schulenberg and searched a suburban hospital where he worked. 
A spokeswoman for North Memorial Medical Center says Schulenberg was a primary care physician at its Minnetonka clinic but he no longer works for the health care system. A message left Tuesday at the physician&apos;s home wasn&apos;t immediately returned. 
Prince died April 21 at his Minnesota home. Autopsy results are pending. Related content

GREAT Witley Church is set to reopen with a new roof after meeting their fundraising target of £130,000. 
The Baroque parish church closed its doors to visitors from January 4 to allow for its slate roof – which has been in place for more than 100 years – to be stripped and replaced. 
Work was required to prevent leaks that could cause damage to the interior of the building. 
It will now re-open on Sunday, May 15, after receiving over 800 donations along with grants. 
A spokesperson said: &quot;With the aid of grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the National Churches Trust – among others – and four years of fundraising activities which culminated in a &apos;Sponsor a Slate&apos; campaign, the target of £130,000 was finally achieved. 
&quot;Over 800 people, both local and from all over the world, donated money to have their dedication written on a slate, raising nearly £10,000. 
&quot;Fifteen local volunteers worked hard to make sure that all the names and dedications were written on the slates before they went up on the roof.&quot; 
Other fundraising activities included a talk by Henry Sandon – Worcester’s own porcelain expert – and an evening with cookery writer Josceline Dimbleby, who spoke about her links to Great Witley. Share:

Greiner Packaging Corp. Greiner Packaging&apos;s U.S. facility in Pittston, Pa. 
Germany-based packaging group Greiner Packaging is cutting staff in Rastatt, Germany. 
“The production site ... was not successful in the last few years because of the outdated technologies/machines we were using there,&quot; marketing director Joerg Sabo told Plastics News Europe. &quot;We need in Germany a product portfolio which is on a long view economically successful and guarantees stability for the employees as well as the production site. Therefore we have to update our machines and use new technologies.” 
There are currently 90 people employed at the Rastatt site and Sabo states that the company cannot say for certain how many jobs will be lost, as it depends on a collaboration with the works council. But Greiner Packaging estimates that around 50 jobs in total will be lost, with half of them probably being contract workers. 
Greiner Packaging is one of five branches of the Greiner Group. The Greiner Group currently operates in more than 133 locations. It contains Greiner Packaging, Greiner Bio-One International, Greiner Foam International, Greiner Perfoam, and Greiner Tool.Tec. 
It recently opened a U.S. plant in Pittston, Pa. 
Greiner Packaging employs around 3,400 employees at 31 locations in 17 countries worldwide. Most Popular

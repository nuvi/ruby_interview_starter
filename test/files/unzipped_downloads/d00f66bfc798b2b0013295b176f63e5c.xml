BATON ROUGE – Paul Mainieri lived a boyhood Notre Dame dream from 1995 through 2006. 
He was the Fighting Irish baseball coach and lived on Wayne Street in Old South Bend about a mile from campus and just a few houses from the former home of Knute Rockne – Notre Dame’s iconic football coach and five-time national champion from 1918-30. Mainieri’s son Nick worked as a quality control assistant on the staff of then-football coach Charlie Weis and graduated from Notre Dame. His daughter Samantha would also graduate from Notre Dame and would become cheerleader captain. 
Mainieri in 2002 became the first coach to take Notre Dame to the College World Series since 1957 and so far is the last one, and Notre Dame’s appearance in the NCAA postseason last year was its first since Mainieri left. Sixty of his Fighting Irish players were drafted by or signed free agent contracts with Major League Baseball teams. 
“I turned down six jobs while I was there,” Mainieri said this week. “It was my dream job.” 
A star quarterback at Christopher Columbus Catholic School for Boys in Miami, Mainieri’s first dream was to play quarterback for that Catholic private school in South Bend, Indiana. 
“I’d listen to every play of the Notre Dame games on the radio or watch them on TV,” Mainieri said. 
Every Sunday morning, he would watch the nationally syndicated replays of Notre Dame games with announcers Lindsey Nelson and former Notre Dame Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Paul Hornung. 
“I couldn’t wait until Sunday mornings,” he said. “I hated when they would say, ‘We move to further action,’ because I wanted to see every play. I’d paint my cleats the way Notre Dame’s cleats were.” 
Make that dream job 1A. Mainieri left Notre Dame after the 2006 season to return to LSU, where he played outfield in 1976 and where he met his wife Karen. 
“I love Notre Dame,” Mainieri said. “It’s a very special place and a very special place to me and my family.” 
Mainieri will coach a team at Notre Dame’s 2,500-seat Frank Eck Stadium on Tuesday for the first time since his last season there in 2006 when the Irish averaged capacity crowds. No. 11 LSU (31-16, 14-10 Southeastern Conference, No. 17 RPI) plays the Fighting Irish (24-12, 11-7 Atlantic Coast Conference, No. 72 RPI) at 5 p.m. Tuesday and 5 p.m. Wednesday on ESPN3. Then Mainieri will coach LSU in a three-game SEC series at Tennessee in Lindsey Nelson Stadium. 
Karen Mainieri and sons Nick and Thomas have made the trip with the Tigers. Notre Dame assistant athletic director Brant Ust, who played for Mainieri at Notre Dame in the 1990s, has arranged for 30 or so other former Mainieri players to take part in an Irish reunion over the next two days. 
“Well, I can’t lie. I have kept Notre Dame and South Bend, Indiana, out of my mind purposely,” Mainieri said before boarding a bus with his team at Alex Box Stadium for the flight to South Bend on Monday. “I’ve had so much other stuff to focus on, of course. But as the time has gotten a little bit closer and I’ve started to have some contact with people up there, it’s starting to play with my emotions a little bit, to be honest with you. Seeing my former players is going to be very emotional because I have a special relationship with them.” 
Mainieri’s career began to take off when he left the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he coached the baseball team from 1989 through 1994, for the Notre Dame job at a yearly salary of $54,000. 
“My wife’s going back, my two sons are going with me,” he said. “So in a weird way, it’s going to feel like going back in time a little bit. It’s going to be strange, but it’s going to be fun.” 
Mainieri was 533-213 in 12 years at Notre Dame, which he led to nine NCAA postseason appearances, including that CWS, and to five Big East Tournament titles and four Big East regular season championships. 
“I’ve had a lot of great experiences on that field,” he said. “Exciting times.” 
But Notre Dame was still Dream Job 1A to Mainieri, who turned down jobs at Oklahoma, the University of New Orleans and Mississippi State, among others, to stay at Notre Dame. After taking his wife a year after Hurricane Katrina to New Orleans, where she grew up, for a landmark birthday in 2006, Mainieri contemplated Dream Job 1. 
LSU athletic director and former baseball coach Skip Bertman, LSU’s version of Rockne with five national championships, called Mainieri about his baseball opening that summer. Bertman was the pitching coach at the University of Miami before coming to LSU in 1984 and knew Mainieri’s father, Demie Mainieri, a Hall of Fame and national championship coach at Miami-Dade North Community College. As a kid, Mainieri visited Bertman’s home with his father. 
Mainieri wanted the LSU dream so bad, he paid for it – literally. 
By 2006, Mainieri was making a salary of $148,666 a year from Notre Dame with a total package worth nearly $200,000. But he had three years remaining on a five-year contract under athletic director Kevin White, the former Tulane athletic director who is now Duke’s athletic director, having replaced current LSU athletic director Joe Alleva. 
When White bumped Mainieri in salary, his new pay bracket also put him in a dual binding agreement at Notre Dame. This meant Mainieri would have to pay Notre Dame a buyout of approximately $446,000 – his salary over three years - to become the coach at LSU. And Notre Dame wanted it within 30 days. 
“I met with my accountant and he told me that basically I would have to work at LSU for five years to be at the same position financially I was at Notre Dame at the time,” Mainieri said. “That’s assuming I’d be successful at LSU. It was a risk.” 
LSU gave Mainieri a $150,000 signing bonus – about $90,000 after taxes - to help offset the buyout along with his new salary of $450,000. But he was still taking a financial gamble. Mainieri’s daughters Alexandra and Samantha got free in-state tuition at Ball State and at Notre Dame when their father was employed at Notre Dame. That went away with his job change as they stayed at their colleges. The housing market in Baton Rouge in 2006 was no financial planner’s dream either, considering Post Katrina. 
“So I took out a loan for the $446,000 and wrote Notre Dame the check,” Mainieri said. “It was in the contract, but I thought they could have waived it or waived some of it based on the fact that I had been there 12 years, was underpaid for most of those and wasn’t looking for a job. I turned down six of them – three in the Big 12 and two in the SEC.” 
White stuck to his guns. 
“An athletic director has a responsibility to his coaches as well as to the institution,” White said in a phone interview Monday. “Where we were at Notre Dame in baseball at the time and baseball in the SEC are two different worlds. And they still are.” 
In the end, Notre Dame made money on Mainieri’s departure as they paid new coach Dave Schrage far less than what Mainieri was making. 
“So, I basically paid the new coach’s salary for a few years,” Mainieri said. “I didn’t think that was right, but I didn’t want to burn any bridges.” 
Schrage was replaced after the 2010 season by Mik Aoki, who guided the Irish to the NCAA postseason last year. 
White has also stuck to his beliefs about Mainieri, whom he did reward financially eventually after taking over at Notre Dame in 2000. 
“He’s terrific,” White said. “He’s the best. He is seriously passionate and has unqualified integrity. He is truly one of the great coaches in college athletics. And we did try to keep him at Notre Dame. We did what we could. But the environment of college baseball is just different at the bigger schools in the South like an LSU.” 
So Mainieri took the gamble, and in what would have been the last year of his five-year contract at Notre Dame in 2009, he won the national championship at LSU after returning the Tigers to Omaha, Nebraska, and the College World Series in just his second year in 2008. There have been return trips in 2013 and last year along with three SEC championships and six SEC Tournament titles. 
“I was disappointed they held me to the buyout,” Mainieri said. “But time heals all wounds. I don’t hold any animosity toward Notre Dame. It was a wonderful experience for 12 years for myself and family. We loved it there. We really did. At the end of the day, I came to LSU because of the opportunity. LSU was the only school I would’ve left Notre Dame for.” 
Mainieri, who turned 49 shortly after taking the LSU job, knew it was time to leave the comforts of Old South Bend. There was little pressure there to get to Omaha. There was little criticism of him. He may have taken Notre Dame as far as it could go given the culture of the school. 
“I wanted to test myself to see if I could win big and win a national championship at a place with all the resources, all the history, the great conference, the great weather, everything,” he said. “It was time to make the move.” 
And five years after the move, he got that buyout loan paid off and is up to $750,000 in salary now at LSU. 
“Coming to LSU was worth the risk,” he said. “I’m lucky. It’s not often that a guy gets two of his dream jobs. And there is no third one.”

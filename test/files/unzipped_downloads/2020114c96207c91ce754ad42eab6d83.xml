Deep Silver has released the first video of Dead Island Retro Revenge. The 16-bit-style beat ‘em up is a free pack-in with Dead Island Definitive Collection. The video is narrated by Max, the Jack Black-sounding protagonist who is on a quest to find his cat through the zombie-filled streets of California. He’s not only up against the undead but also corrupt soldiers and rowdy inmates. In addition to a variety of weapons, he’ll also have access to power-ups, super attacks, and combos. 
Dead Island Definitive Collection is scheduled to launch on May 31 for $39.99 for PC, PS4, and Xbox One. Dead Island and Riptide will be available separately digitally for $19.99.

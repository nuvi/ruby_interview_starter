Menlo Park: Beltramo&apos;s closing after 134 years By Kevin Kelly Posted: 05/10/2016 08:50:23 AM PDT Updated: 05/10/2016 03:42:18 PM PDT MENLO PARK -- The city&apos;s oldest retail business plans to close its doors for good by summer&apos;s end. 
Beltramo&apos;s Wine and Spirits, family-owned and in continuous operation since 1882, announced Monday that its run is coming to an end. 
&quot;It&apos;s time,&quot; general manager Diana Beltramo Hewitt told The Daily News. &quot;My uncle&apos;s 81 and my dad&apos;s 80, and they deserve to go fishing.&quot; 
Beltramo Hewitt, whose great grandfather Giovanni (John) Beltramo founded the wine store 134 years ago shortly after arriving in Menlo Park from Italy, said she and her other siblings are unable to take the reins from John and Daniel Beltramo, the current owners.

Beltramo&apos;s announced on Monday that the business will close for good by summer&apos;s end. (Kevin Kelly/Daily News) 
&quot;I very much enjoyed my time here,&quot; said Beltramo Hewitt, who has managed Beltramo&apos;s for the past five years. &quot;It really just comes down to the hours. ... I&apos;m not prepared to take over the entire enterprise.&quot; 
Four other siblings pursued careers outside of the liquor industry, she said, and the fifth generation of the Beltramos is too young to take the helm. 
&quot;While we&apos;re sad to close, we feel like we&apos;re going out on top,&quot; Beltramo Hewitt said. &quot;We feel we can shut the doors with a lot of pride and a whole lot of good memories.&quot; 
She said the property is for sale and a buyer has been identified, adding that she was fairly confident the new owner would not operate a wine shop at the 1540 El Camino Real location. Beltramo&apos;s has operated at the site since 1935, when it moved from Glenwood Avenue two years after Prohibition ended to stay outside of Stanford&apos;s 1½-mile dry zone. That ban was fully lifted in 1979. Advertisement 
The store was busy Monday with longtime customers coming in to wish the owners a happy retirement. 
&quot;The comments we&apos;ve been getting are very supportive,&quot; Beltramo Hewitt said. &quot;Those who know my dad and uncle are very happy for them to spend a little more time having fun.&quot; 
Beltramo Hewitt said the last day of operation hasn&apos;t been decided but Beltramo&apos;s will &quot;be closed by the end of summer for sure.&quot; She said the store would likely be offering discounts and deals in the near future. Email Kevin Kelly at or call him at 650-391-1049.

A gang associate who allegedly brandished a gun inside a Yaletown restaurant on May 1 has posted photos and videos of himself with guns on his social media sites, Postmedia has learned. 
James Carlton Lewis, 29, has also put up an infamous group photo of members of the United Nations gang on his Instagram account, under his rapper name — General Beanz. 
Lewis was arrested by the Vancouver Police on May 1 following 911 calls saying a man had pulled a gun inside a restaurant after a dispute broke out. 
He is now in custody facing charges of possession of a prohibited firearm with ammunition, uttering threats, careless use and storage of a firearm and occupying a vehicle knowing a firearm is present. 
He is scheduled to appear in Vancouver Provincial Court May 12 for a bail hearing. 
VPD media officer Const. Brian Montague said Lewis has warrants out of Alberta and Ontario for his arrest and a lengthy criminal record in both those provinces. 
Montague said VPD officers “responded to a report of an argument between a group of people that involved a firearm in a Yaletown restaurant shortly after 9 p.m. on May 1st. 
“Police located a cab near Homer and Davie Street with two men believed involved and took them into custody and a loaded handgun was located. Both men have gang associations,” Montague said. 
Also charged is Louie Mojica, a 27-year-old Calgary resident who “is familiar to police in Alberta,” Montague said. 
Mojica, who faces one count of occupying a vehicle knowing a firearm is present, is due back in court May 11. 
Lewis raps under the name General Beanz and is featured on the website Cutthroat Mafia, which books concerts and other appearances for him and other rappers. 
[Related: You can listen to a recording here . WARNING: Graphic content] 
He sometimes raps with another gangster named Nicholas (Gon Gotti) Perron, who is listed as Cutthroat’s CEO on the site. 
He was also identified in an Ontario court case as a member of the Calgary Fresh Off the Boat Killers (FK). Perron was convicted in Waterloo, Ont. in 2013 of weapons trafficking and robbery and was sentenced to 3.5 years. 
Cutthroat’s website stated that Perron and Lewis rapped at a Vancouver nightclub on March 26. 
The FK is closely aligned with the United Nations gang, founded in B.C. in 1997 by Clay Roueche. 
Two Calgary men linked to the FK were charged earlier this year with conspiring to kill the Bacon brothers in B.C. 
Staff Sgt. Lindsey Houghton, of the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit, said “the links between the FK and the United Nations go back many years. 
“This is not unlike a lot of other gangs, especially in British Columbia, where they establish connections and even working relationships, business relationships with gangs and criminal organizations across Canada and even internationally.” 
Lewis posted one video to YouTube where he is firing off a shotgun in what looks like a rural area. He is disparaging police and saying Cutthroat Mafia is “shutting sh-t down … coast to coast.” 
In another video he is slapping a young guy who claimed to have been arrested. 
There are also photos of him posing with handguns, though some appear to be promotional videos for rap events. 
Lewis’s rap persona, General Beanz, is listed as one of his aliases on his B.C. court file. 
The VPD is “aware of his past and alternate name as well as his associations here and in other provinces,” Montague said. 
Houghton said the use of popular culture to promote gang violence and attack police is not new, though it now extends to social media. 
He noted that more than two decades ago, controversy erupted over the 1992 song “Cop Killer” by Ice T. 
“It’s been around for a long time,” Houghton said.

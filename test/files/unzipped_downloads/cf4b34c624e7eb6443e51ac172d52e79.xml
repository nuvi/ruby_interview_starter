Judge exceeds sentencing guidelines for Ionia heroin dealer &apos;You don&apos;t seem to have much to offer the community&apos; Sykes says Comment Posted May. 10, 2016 at 4:51 PM By Nicholas Grenke Posted May. 10, 2016 at 4:51 PM IONIA An Ionia man received more time behind bars than he anticipated on Tuesday after he was sentenced for selling heroin. Oran Hussein Muhqueed, 45, of Ionia was arrested in Ionia Township in January by Central Michigan Enforcement Team officers and local law enforcement. During Muhqueed&apos;s arrest, CMET detectives found heroin packaged for sale. The defendant pleaded guilty to both counts and in doing so negotiated a plea bargain for the bottom end of sentencing guidelines, which called for a 10 month jail sentence. However, Ionia County Circuit Probate Court Judge Robert Sykes said he didn&apos;t intend to abide by the agreement after he listed several of Muhqeed&apos;s prior convictions, which led to prison sentences for domestic violence, criminal sexual conduct and other drug crimes. “I&apos;m having a difficult time seeing why I should follow those guidelines,” Sykes said. “Ten months after being discharged from parole you&apos;re selling heroin.” “You don&apos;t seem to have much to offer the community,” he added. Sykes is serving as an Ionia County Circuit Court judge on the case because current Ionia County Circuit Court Judge Ron Schafer was involved with the original investigation when he was the Ionia County Prosecuting Attorney. Sykes informed Muhqueed that said he intended to sentence him to 23 months in prison, and offered the defendant the chance to withdraw his guilty plea. After Muhqueed talked with his attorney, Michael Honeywell, the defendant agreed to continue with pleading guilty. “We&apos;re not happy with where the court is at, but we&apos;re willing to move forward,” Honeywell said. In the end, the judge sentenced Muhqueed to 23 months in prison with credit for 123 days served. Follow Nicholas Grenke on Twitter @NickSJ86. By Nicholas Grenke

Georgia Debates Stalin and NATO Eurasianet Wednesday 11th May, 2016 The South Caucasus country of Georgia marked May 9, the day former Soviet republics celebrate the 1945 victory over Nazi Germany, with a debate about its Stalinist past and its NATO future.
As per tradition, elderly communists dusted off photos of their favorite Soviet dictator, wartime leader Joseph Stalin, as well as Soviet flags and World War II medals. Demanding the return of a monument to the Great Leader, they paradedStalin&apos;s bust through his hometown of Gori. 
But this year they faced a rival rally, in which several rock bands performed to prove that Stalin is not the only rock star in town. 
Just as the Communists marched with slogans proclaiming &apos;Glory to Stalin!,&apos; young activists gathered nearby with slogans declaring &apos;Totalitarianism Kills!&apos; and &apos;Gori Is Not Red.&apos; The red stars were pitted against the stars of the European Union, the place where Georgia, at least most of it, hopes to be in the future. 
&apos;The victory over fascism was undoubtedly a momentous event. Nobody denies that,&apos; activist Nino Dalakishvilitold Netgazeti.ge. &apos;However, today when we see that [World War II] veterans are being used by political forces and these forces are being sponsored by Russia, we believe this is detrimental to our country. This is what we rally against. We want to defend our nation&apos;s progressive, pro-Western policy.&apos; 
There are widespread concerns that Moscow, seeking a political foothold in Georgia, is enabling the growing, but still relatively marginal anti-Western rhetoric in the country.

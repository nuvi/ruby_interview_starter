Under the terms of the Forbearance Agreement, among other things, the Lenders agreed to forbear from exercising enforcement rights and remedies arising from the Company&apos;s failure to pay the cash interest and principal payments due on March 31, 2016 until the earlier of April 30, 2016 ; the occurrence of an event of default under the Amended Term Loan Facility, unrelated to the failure to pay principal and interest due on March 31, 2016 ; or the occurrence of a default or breach of representation by the Company under the Forbearance Agreement.

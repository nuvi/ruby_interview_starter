One View: City Council cannot make the pie bigger Roger Stockton 2:22 p.m. PDT May 10, 2016 Roger Stockton (Photo: Provided to the RGJ) 
The Reno City Council asked city manager Andrew Clinger to come back with a budget that focuses on &quot;council&quot; priorities as opposed to the budget submitted that divides current city revenue to accommodate current spending obligations. The best way to explain this would be a lesson in priorities and pies. First, the council must identify the city&apos;s priorities from most to least important to determine where the available money is spent. Secondly, they need a lesson in pie making. 
The city manager was able to take the available ingredients (that is, tax revenue) and baked an eight-inch pie that was divided into slices to fund city services. The mayor and city council were unhappy with the pie and sent him back to bake a ten-inch pie that will fund the basic services and their pet projects in spite of the fact that there are not enough ingredients to make such a pie. 
It is common for politicians who do not understand budgets to believe that by some miracle of accounting, four dollars can be made from two. The reality is that it does not work. If the City Council wants to increase spending on one program, they are going to have to find another to cut. This will not go over well with city employee unions who gave generously to many of their campaigns, but remembering that they were elected to represent Reno residents and taxpayers first would be a good place to start. Schieve on proposed budget: Go back to the drawing board 
Unfortunately, the mayor and council have not shown a willingness to make cuts — or, for that matter, make hard decisions in general. It is telling that rather than fund programs they want to expand — such as more police — when extra money was found, they rushed to spend on new programs instead. As they contemplate more cronyism with a proposed $1.2 billion downtown development supplemented with $100 million in city dollars, did any of them think to ask how they are going to maintain essential services once they take 17 acres of current properties off the tax rolls? 
The hardworking taxpayers of Reno deserve and must demand better from those we elect to manage our great city. The job of the City Council is to assure that city services benefit every resident of Reno, and sometimes that means making tough choices, including saying, &quot;we cannot afford it&quot;. Mayor Hillary Schieve said she wants to fund more police officers and code enforcement in next year&apos;s budget. Anjeanette Damon 
The message to the council is simple. You were elected to lead and if you are unable or unwilling, you should step aside. If you won&apos;t, it is up to the voters of Reno to elect new representatives who are up to the task. Voters need to take a hard look at who is representing us and those looking to replace them. It is not unreasonable to expect that the mayor and City Council understand how do divide the pie to the benefit of the city as a whole.

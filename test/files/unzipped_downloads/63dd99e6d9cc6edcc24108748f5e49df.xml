The Latest: Clinton says GOP will throw &apos;kitchen sink&apos; at me - WXOW News 19 La Crosse, WI â€“ News, Weather and Sports | Member Center: The Latest: Clinton says GOP will throw &apos;kitchen sink&apos; at me Posted: Updated: (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin).

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on the 2016 presidential campaign (all times local): 
6:41 p.m. 
Hillary Clinton predicts Republicans will &quot;throw everything including the kitchen sink at me&quot; in the general election, but the Democratic front-runner has a message for them. 
She says, &quot;They&apos;ve done it for 25 years and I&apos;m still standing.&quot; 
Clinton says at a campaign event in Louisville, Kentucky, on Tuesday that she looks forward to debating presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. 
Clinton is urging Kentucky voters to &quot;have a big vote&quot; next week in the state&apos;s presidential primary to help her campaign &quot;get ready to go all the way to November.&quot; 
Clinton was rallying supporters in Louisville shortly before the polls were closing in West Virginia&apos;s primary. She made no mention of the West Virginia race, where she faces Democratic rival Bernie Sanders. 
___ 
5:50 p.m. 
Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is scheduled to appear later this week at a fundraiser for Republicans on Long Island. 
Trump is headlining the Nassau County Republican Committee&apos;s annual &quot;Patriots Reception&quot; on Wednesday. Tickets to the event are $200 each. 
The fundraiser was scheduled before Trump took control of the nomination process with a win last week in Indiana. 
It comes amid negotiations between the celebrity businessman and the Republican National Committee about fundraising for the general election. 
To this point, Trump has self-funded much of his campaign. He told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he&apos;s leaning against accepting public financing of his campaign. 
___ 
5:27 p.m. 
Many West Virginians voting in the state&apos;s presidential primary say they see the economy as the top issue facing the country, and they think trade is costing America jobs. 
More than half of West Virginia Republicans and nearly two-thirds of Democratic voters casting ballots on Tuesday say the economy is the top issue facing the country. 
That&apos;s according to early findings from exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research. 
In the West Virginia Democratic primary, 7 in 10 say they&apos;re very worried about the economy and another 2 in 10 say they&apos;re somewhat worried. 
Majorities of voters in both primaries say trade with other countries mostly takes jobs from American workers. 
___ 
5:12 p.m. 
West Virginia is holding a Democratic primary election on Tuesday, but a significant portion of voters choosing between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders say they don&apos;t identify as Democrats. 
About 4 in 10 voters in the state&apos;s Democratic primary say they consider themselves to be an independent or Republican. That&apos;s according to early findings from exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research. 
Among those voting in West Virginia&apos;s Democratic primary, about a third say they would support presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump over either Clinton or Sanders in November&apos;s general election. 
An additional 2 in 10 say they wouldn&apos;t vote for Trump, Clinton or Sanders this fall. 
___ 
5:05 p.m. 
GOP runner-up Ted Cruz has returned to the Senate, promising to roll up his sleeves and take on &quot;the issues that were the heart of our presidential campaign.&quot; 
What the Texas Republican is yet unwilling to promise is an endorsement of presumptive nominee Donald Trump. 
Asked about endorsing Trump, Cruz said: &quot;What I am interested in supporting are free-market principles and the constitutional liberties of America.&quot; 
Cruz addressed a media throng outside his Senate office Tuesday afternoon before being greeted by an ovation from his staff. 
He is widely unpopular among his Senate colleagues. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was asked whether he&apos;s going to be working more closely with Cruz than he has in the past. McConnell replied, I&apos;m happy to have him back and you ought to ask him that.&quot; 
___ 
4:40 p.m. 
Hillary Clinton says presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump would lead a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; on the economy, to the detriment of working families. 
Clinton knocked Trump at a Tuesday campaign event in Louisville, Kentucky, saying that Trump has argued Americans are being paid too much and has talked about getting rid of the federal minimum wage. 
The Democratic presidential candidate says Trump would leave the minimum wage &quot;to the mercy of Republican governors.&quot; 
Clinton made no mention of Democratic rival Bernie Sanders hours before polls close in West Virginia&apos;s Democratic primary. 
She says with Trump, &quot;you would see a race to the bottom across our country with working families paying the price.&quot; 
The former secretary of state outlined steps during her visit to Kentucky to help workers pay for child care. 
___ 
4:25 p.m. 
Donald Trump says he&apos;s narrowed his list of potential running mates to &quot;five or six people,&quot; all with deep political resumes. 
In an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said he has not ruled out New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie - a former rival who has embraced the billionaire&apos;s campaign with gusto. 
Trump says said he&apos;s prioritizing political experience, because he wants a vice president to help him &quot;with legislation, getting things through&quot; Washington if he wins the White House. 
Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer are among the Republicans who have suggested they would be open to joining Trump on the GOP ticket. 
Others have ruled out being considered, including Trump&apos;s former primary rival, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. 
___ 
4 p.m. 
Vice President Joe Biden is predicting that Hillary Clinton will win the Democratic Party&apos;s nomination and says he feels confident that she&apos;ll be the next president. 
Biden&apos;s remarks come in an interview with ABC&apos;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; that will be broadcast later Tuesday and Wednesday morning. 
Biden&apos;s comments go further than President Barack Obama has in predicting the outcome of the Democratic primary. Obama has offered no predictions and says that the process should be allowed to play itself out. 
Clinton is engaged in a tougher-than-expected primary with Sen. Bernie Sanders, though she is nearing winning the total number of delegates needed to secure the nomination. 
___ 
1:30 p.m. 
Some voters in Tuesday&apos;s Republican primaries aren&apos;t happy that Donald Trump is their only real choice. 
In Lincoln, Nebraska, 47-year-old Dave George voted for Ted Cruz even though the Texas senator is out of the race. 
George calls Trump a &quot;megalomaniac&quot; and a &quot;caricature&quot; and says he&apos;s astonished the businessman made it this far. 
In west Omaha, 62-year-old Vicki Baines says her favorite Republicans didn&apos;t even make it to the top four. 
After casting her ballot, Baines joked that she wrote in a fictional character she could trust. 
As she put it, &quot;I&apos;m sticking with my man Pinocchio.&quot; 
___ 
1:20 p.m. 
In Cross Lanes, West Virginia, self-described socialist Edward Milam gave money to Bernie Sanders but his vote to Hillary Clinton. 
Milam is a retiree who says he&apos;s been familiar with Clinton for 30 years and doesn&apos;t think she would pull any surprises as president. 
Although he donated to Sanders, he says that after six or so months of watching the contenders, he thinks Clinton &quot;has a lot more to offer&quot; than Sanders internationally. 
___ 
1:15 p.m. 
Hillary Clinton says the nation needs to do more to provide quality child care for families and address the high cost of caring for children. 
Clinton says at an event at a Lexington, Kentucky, child care center that high quality child care is often as expensive as college tuition in many states. 
She says raising children can cause stress for parents and that often makes it difficult to balance work and family obligations. She says it&apos;s something more employers need to understand. 
She&apos;s releasing a plan to ensure families don&apos;t spend more than 10 percent of their income on child care. 
The Democratic presidential candidate is campaigning in Kentucky for the primary next week. 
___ 
12:45 p.m. 
Donald Trump&apos;s campaign manager will oversee the presumptive Republican nominee&apos;s search for a vice presidential candidate. 
Corey Lewandowski will be in charge of the team that will survey and vet potential running mates. That&apos;s according to a person familiar with the decision but not authorized to speak about it before it&apos;s announced. 
Trump has said he&apos;ll name a running mate in July, perhaps at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. 
The political neophyte has said repeatedly that he wants a running mate from the political sphere with government experience - particularly time working on Capitol Hill so he can get things done there and not have to rely on executive orders. 
Lewandowski&apos;s new responsibilities were first reported Tuesday by The Washington Post. 
___ 
12:30 p.m. 
Sen. Ted Cruz isn&apos;t ready to endorse Donald Trump. And if the Texas lawmaker somehow wins Nebraska on Tuesday and suddenly sees a path to the presidential nomination after all, his campaign could be back on track. 
In an interview with Glenn Beck, Cruz says he wants to support a president &quot;we can trust ... with power who demonstrates a temperament not to abuse that power.&quot; 
With Nebraskans voting the week after he exited the campaign, Cruz says he isn&apos;t holding his breath about winning the primary, with his name still on the ballot. But if he did and a path emerged to the nomination, Cruz says he&apos;d &quot;respond accordingly.&quot; 
The senator suspended his campaign after a crushing defeat in Indiana. Before departing, he called Trump a narcissist. 
___ 
10:45 a.m. 
More than 100,000 West Virginians will have their ballots counted in Tuesday&apos;s election, even though the only competitive presidential primary race is on the Democratic side. 
That&apos;s because of heavy participation in early voting. Nearly 101,000 people cast ballots before Tuesday, more than in any other year since early voting was allowed in 2002. And more than 5,000 turned in absentee ballots. 
The headline race is between Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Republican Donald Trump cleared the field of rivals in Indiana last week. 
West Virginians are also voting in a Democratic showdown for governor, a state Supreme Court race and other contests. 
___ 
10 a.m. 
Donald Trump likes to boast that he&apos;ll be setting a record for the number of votes won by any candidate in the history of Republican presidential nomination contests. 
True or false? 
Probably true, and that could happen Tuesday. 
A running total of primary votes maintained by The Associated Press shows that through last week&apos;s Indiana primary, Trump had tallied 10,702,962 total votes. The record for a GOP presidential candidate, researched by political analyst Rhodes Cook&apos;s newsletter, is George W. Bush&apos;s total of 10,844,129 votes in the 2000 primary season. 
That leaves Trump 141,167 votes short of the record. And there are two GOP primaries Tuesday, in West Virginia and Nebraska. He&apos;s got no rivals left, and it remains to be seen whether enough people will come out to vote for him to give him a record-breaking day. 
The overall record for both parties was set by Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2008. She amassed 17,714,899 votes in her losing contest against Barack Obama. He won the nomination while actually polling nearly 300,000 votes fewer than Clinton. 
___ 
9:30 a.m. 
Hillary Clinton has new ads up in Kentucky, where Democrats vote in a primary in a week. Her $161,000 ad buy has a small price tag - but carries a big clue about the campaign&apos;s strategy as the primary contest carries on into June. 
Clinton&apos;s Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders has vowed to continue until the final few states vote next month, even though he has a nearly impossible task catching up with her. Sanders won Indiana last week and is in a strong position in West Virginia, voting Tuesday, and in Oregon, which votes alongside Kentucky next week. 
Clinton&apos;s burst of Kentucky advertising shows she wants to prevent Sanders from notching a winning streak. 
___ 
9:15 a.m. 
A super PAC backing likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is reserving an additional $5.3 million in advertising for the fall, bringing the group&apos;s general election ad plans to more than $130 million. 
The latest Priorities USA purchase is for commercials on black and Hispanic radio stations in Ohio, Florida, Nevada, Colorado and Virginia. So says Priorities spokesman Justin Barasky. 
The group is also announcing the hiring of an African-American media adviser, Jeff Johnson. The Baltimore-based strategist has worked with BET News and the NAACP, among other clients. 
With Donald Trump now the presumptive Republican nominee, Priorities USA plans to begin advertising before its previously planned start date of June 8. 
___ 
7:40 a.m. 
Hillary Clinton is rolling out proposals to curb the cost of child care for working parents. 
Clinton&apos;s campaign says she plans to discuss her child care proposals during a stop at a family health center in Louisville, Kentucky, on Tuesday. She aims to ensure no family pays more than 10 percent of its income on child care through a mix of federal subsidies and tax relief. 
She&apos;s also proposing more spending to boost wages for child care workers and expand home visits by social workers or nurses for new parents. 
The Democratic presidential contender holds a commanding lead among delegates against rival Bernie Sanders. 
Clinton and Sanders are competing in Tuesday&apos;s West Virginia primary. They have races next week in Kentucky and Oregon. 
___ 
7 a.m. 
Congressional Republicans are returning to Capitol Hill to confront an awkward new reality: Donald Trump is their presumptive presidential nominee. But instead of uniting behind him, leading figures like House Speaker Paul Ryan are withholding their support. 
That highly unusual state of affairs is creating a tricky situation for Republicans in the House and Senate. Some of them fear Trump could be a drag on their own re-election chances in a year when the GOP is fighting to hang onto its slim Senate majority. 
Many leading Republicans can bring themselves to support Trump only reluctantly, if at all. And that posture is irritating to others in the party who insist it&apos;s time for the GOP to get behind Trump and start preparing for a likely contest against Democrat Hillary Clinton in November.

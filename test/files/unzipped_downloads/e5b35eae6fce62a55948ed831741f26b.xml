Is Knicks&apos; job going to Rambis? 
All that beautiful ball movement that the Spurs have been known for over the last five or six seasons has disappeared as this series has worn on. San Antonio shot 60 percent and had an incredible 39 assists in the Game 1 rout. 
The Spurs had 19 assists in each of their next two games and then just 12 in the Game 4 loss on Sunday. 
&quot;They have been down, but things do slow down in the playoffs,&quot; Popovich said. &quot;Having said that, we need to have a little bit more ball movement and get a few more passes out on the court, for sure.&quot; 
The stagnancy the Spurs showed on Sunday was a common criticism the Thunder have heard over the years, when at times their offense has devolved into Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook taking turns taking shots. 
&quot;Guys wanted the ball and just didn&apos;t make shots. We never really got into a good offensive rhythm but we kept making runs,&quot; Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge said. &quot;Guys kept making plays at certain times but we had a lot of open looks that we didn&apos;t make. If you don&apos;t make shots, the assists don&apos;t come.&quot; 
The Spurs could also use more of the dominant Aldridge they saw in the first two games. The big free agent prize of last summer exploded for 79 points and made 33 of his 44 shots in the first two games. 
But the Thunder did not panic and make rash adjustments to the game plan. Instead, first-year coach Billy Donovan stuck to the principles they started the series with, refusing to double Aldridge in the post too aggressively. 
Aldridge has scored 44 points on 16-for-39 shooting over the last two games. 
&quot;He&apos;s just missing shots. That&apos;s all it is,&quot; Thunder center Steven Adams said. &quot;We&apos;re sticking to the same principles. He&apos;s just missing shots, thankfully.&quot;

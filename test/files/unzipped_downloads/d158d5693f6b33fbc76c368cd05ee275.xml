The 6 Biggest Reveals From the Orange Is the New Black Season 4 Trailer Comment Posted May. 10, 2016 at 12:08 PM Updated at 3:04 PM Posted May 10, 2016 at 12:08 PM Updated at 3:04 PM Netflix dropped the first official trailer for Orange Is the New Black &apos;s fourth season Tuesday and it is a doozy! After the wonderfully heartwarming lake scene in the Season 3 finale, it seems life at Litchfield has reverted back to its typical scheming, tragic ways. Here are the six biggest reveals from the new trailer. Piper&apos;s in major trouble: Piper ( Taylor Schilling ) has pissed off the wrong people this time. The used underwear kingpin admits she feels truly &quot;unsafe&quot; for the first time since entering the prison, and she isn&apos;t just being paranoid. The trailer shows Maria (Jessica Pimentel) threatening to &quot;bury&quot; Piper, which could explain the previously released photo of Piper being gagged and held down by some of the kitchen girls. What could Piper have done?!? Taystee has power: Taystee ( Danielle Brooks ) has apparently landed the gig of Warden Caputo&apos;s ( Nick Sandow ) secretary, giving her an inside line to everything that&apos;s going down inside Litchfield. Orange Is the New Black Season 4 is &quot;the rise of the Latinas&quot; &quot;It&apos;s sardine time, bitches&quot;: Now that Litchfield is a prison-for-profit, dozens of new inmates are squeezed into the already crowded premises, which means there&apos;s about 100 new people for our favorite characters to fight with. And based on an angry phone call for Caputo, it doesn&apos;t appear as though Litchfield has the staff it needs to handle the growing population. Alex has a secret: Although we still haven&apos;t seen Alex ( Laura Prepon ) since Kubra&apos;s lackey pulled a gun on her in the greenhouse, her voice makes a brief appearance in the trailer. &quot;Can you keep a secret?&quot; Alex is heard asking Red ( Kate Mulgrew ). It&apos;s not a lot to go on, but we&apos;re excited to see that A) Alex is 100 percent alive and B) She&apos;s teaming up with her former prison mom once again. Page 2 of 2 - Litchfield gets swatted: Caputo&apos;s reign as warden is really not working out as he had hoped. At one point in the trailer, a SWAT team storms Litchfield. But why? Could there be a prison riot heading our way? Love is in the air: Despite all the insanity around them, it looks as though Poussey ( Samira Wiley ) and Soso ( Kimiko Glenn ) have managed to stay together. Maritza ( Diane Guerrero ) also shares a weighted look with one of the guards that reeks of a possible affair. And while I&apos;m excited at the possibility of Maritza getting a real storyline this season, something tells me this won&apos;t end well. What did you think of the trailer? Orange is the New Black returns on Friday, June 17. Other Links From TVGuide.com

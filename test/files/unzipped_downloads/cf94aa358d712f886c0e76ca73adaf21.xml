Hubbard Broadcasting founder Stanley Hubbard is now backing GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump. 
That’s a switch because Hubbard, a big donor to Republican candidates, is joining a pro-Trump super PAC. 
Previously, Hubbard had donated $10,000 to Our Principles PAC, which opposed Trump, reports Politico. 
Hubbard told Politico he’s still no Trump fan, but views him as a better choice for the country than Democrat Hillary Clinton.

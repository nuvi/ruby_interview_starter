The President is now in London for the anti-corruption summit which is bringing together the leaders of 60 countries to sign a pact that makes it impossible for fraudulent criminals to use these countries as safe havens. 
This is even after the British Prime Minister David Camron had labeled Nigeria as one of the most corrupt countries in the world. The statement has met with public outrage with even Buhari stating that the quip was embarrassing. 
The President will make a speech and will hopefully be able to foster better relationships with the home countries of the other participants. 
You can see the images below.

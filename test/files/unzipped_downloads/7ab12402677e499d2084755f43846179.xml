Michigan Senate OKs ban on local regulation of plastic bags Efforts to rid Michigan communities of plastic shopping bags would be banned under legislation approved Tuesday by the Senate, where business concerns won out over fears that the bags are harmful to the environment. Comment By DAVID EGGERT, Associated Press Ionia Sentinel - Standard-Ionia, MI By DAVID EGGERT, Associated Press Posted May. 10, 2016 at 4:13 PM By DAVID EGGERT, Associated Press Posted May. 10, 2016 at 4:13 PM LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Efforts to rid Michigan communities of plastic shopping bags would be banned under legislation approved Tuesday by the Senate, where business concerns won out over fears that the bags are harmful to the environment. The Republican-controlled chamber voted 25-12, mostly along party lines, to send the bill to the House for its consideration. The measure would prohibit local governments from enacting ordinances that regulate, prohibit or impose a fee on the use or sale of &quot;auxiliary containers&quot; — defined as reusable or single-use bags, cups, bottles or other packaging from stores and restaurants. More than 150 municipalities across the country have passed ordinances either to ban the environmentally unfriendly plastic bags or to charge a fee for them. None are in Michigan, though at least two counties — Washtenaw and Muskegon — are considering whether to limit the bags. The bill sponsor, Republican Sen. Jim Stamas of Midland, said lawmakers have the responsibility to provide &quot;consistency on one side of the road versus the other,&quot; helping retailers avoid a patchwork of rules. But opponents accused the GOP majority of again overriding the authority of locally elected officials. Gov. Rick Snyder and fellow Republicans last year enacted a law that prevents municipalities from requiring businesses to pay wages, benefits or provide sick days exceeding state or federal requirements. &quot;We don&apos;t need a one-size state solution to every problem facing local government. We need to let our communities and democracy work,&quot; said Democratic Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr. of East Lansing. Sen. Rebekah Warren, an Ann Arbor Democrat whose district includes Washtenaw County, said local officials — including business leaders — are trying to address problems caused when plastic bags and food containers are sent to landfills, litter the streets and clog up machines at recycling facilities. Twenty-four Republicans and one Democrat, David Knezek of Dearborn Heights, voted for the legislation. Nine Democrats and three Republicans — Ken Horn of Frankenmuth, Rick Jones of Grand Ledge and Tory Rocca of Sterling Heights — opposed it. The New York City Council last week approved a bill, which the mayor will sign, to require most merchants to charge customers at least a nickel for each bag, including those made of paper. ___

Downtown San Jose fireworks show gets county funding By Eric Kurhi Posted: 05/10/2016 11:59:59 AM PDT Updated: 05/10/2016 04:04:50 PM PDT SAN JOSE -- Santa Clara County is joining the effort to bring professional fireworks to town for Fourth of July fun this summer with three professional shows, securing funding from county officials on Tuesday, including the popular event in downtown San Jose. 
&quot;This builds on our tradition of celebrating this holiday in a safe manner,&quot; said Santa Clara County Supervisor Cindy Chavez, adding that illegal fireworks have caused numerous fires and injuries in the past. 
&quot;Several people have been maimed by illegal fireworks in the last three years alone,&quot; she said. 
The other organizations getting county funding for public events are the cities of Santa Clara and Milpitas and the Almaden Valley Women&apos;s Club. 
The downtown event has drawn 80,000 to 90,000 people annually since its resurrection in 2014. It is sponsored by the Rotary Club and takes place at Discovery Meadow, with support from the city of San Jose, the Knight Foundation and firms including Adobe Systems, Arcadia Development and Core Companies, with the county joining the funding effort this year.

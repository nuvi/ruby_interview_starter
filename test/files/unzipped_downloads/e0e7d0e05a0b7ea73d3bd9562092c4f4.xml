An 11-year-old boy is facing hate crime charges after authorities say he set a school bus on fire in Brooklyn .
The NYPD says police received a 911 call around 6 p.m. Sunday of a fire at Brooklyn Avenue and Lefferts Boulevard.
Ads By Artscroll: As many as five boys were on the parked bus when the boy lit the fire outside a Jewish elementary school in the Crown Heights section, police say.
Police say the driver had left the door unlocked and the boy set the fire inside. There was no one on the bus at the time.
When the bus caught fire, the boys jumped off and ran away.
One witness saw the teens and was able to identify an 11-year-old neighborhood boy.
The boy was arrested on charges of arson as a hate crime and criminal mischief as a hate crime.

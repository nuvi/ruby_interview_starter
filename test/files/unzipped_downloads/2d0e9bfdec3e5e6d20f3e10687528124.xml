Young love! 
The mother of a toddler with autism captured a sweet moment between her son and a Disney princess on a recent trip to Disney World. 
Amanda Coley uploaded a video of her two-year-old son Jack Jack and Snow White on Facebook and YouTube earlier this week. She said in the post that her son wanted nothing to do with any of the characters, until he met Snow White. 
“You see, he has autism and is non-verbal,” Coley wrote in a May 9 YouTube post. “He is on the shy side with people he does not know.” 
In the video, Jack Jack stares adoringly at Snow White and lays his head on her lap repeatedly. 
“I must have cried 1000 tears watching his interaction with her,” Coley said. “He was in love.”

Stalin Bust In Georgia Covered In Pink Paint RFE Tuesday 10th May, 2016 A bust of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin has been bathed in pink paint in Georgia.
The bust was erected by Stalin supporters in the Gori district on May 9, celebrated as Victory Day in Russia and some other former Soviet republics to commemorate Nazi Germany&apos;s defeat in World War II. 
Local activists Lola Lomidze and Beso Loria said on May 10 that they poured pink paint on the bust overnight. 
Stalin supporters placed the bust in the village of Ateni without obtaining permission from local authorities. It is not the first attempt by Stalinist activists in the region to erect his bust. 
The Gori district is Stalin&apos;s birthplace. A big sculpture of Stalin erected in Gori in the 1950s was removed by Georgian authorities in June 2010.

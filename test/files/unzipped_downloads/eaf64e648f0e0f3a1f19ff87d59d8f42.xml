West Princeton residents ask Birmingham City Council for greater police presence Resident: &apos;We want the city to clean our neighborhood up!&apos; Published 5:50 PM CDT May 10, 2016

The council and mayor don&apos;t always listen to each other but Tuesday they heard loud and clear from a woman named Hattie Williams. Related 
“A bullet came through my bedroom window when I was there,” said Williams, who has lived in the same house for almost 40 years. 
She went before the City Council Monday and said things have gone from bad to near-fatal. 
“About two weeks ago there were 15 shots on the corner,” Williams said. “I had to hit the floor and 15 neighbors called me and said ‘Have you called the police?’” 
Mayor William Bell met with Williams, who&apos;s the grandmother of &quot;American Idol&quot; winner Ruben Studdard, and others from the rising West Princeton neighborhood. 
Residents there say things are getting out of control: drug use, prostitution, shootings that happen almost every day and night. They want and demand more police presence. 
“We want the city to clean our neighborhood up,” Williams said. 
Bell promised more resources to fight blight and crime in west Princeton and will visit on May 20. 
Councilors were also moved. 
“I know this is gonna be some sacrifices that we&apos;re gonna have to make as a city to put resources in every neighborhood on the same level,” Councilor Lashunda Scales said. 
“The most important thing is we stay focused on cleaning up our neighborhoods, tearing down abandoned homes, cutting vacant lots and fighting crime,” Austin said.

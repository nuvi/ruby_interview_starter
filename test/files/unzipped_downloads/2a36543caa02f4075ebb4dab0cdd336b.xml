Teen cleared of rape jailed for Kidderminster pub assault Teen cleared of rape jailed for Kidderminster pub assault Share: 0 comments 
A KIDDERMINSTER teenager has been jailed after he went out to celebrate being cleared of rape and ended the night punching two men in the face. 
Thomas Eggington got into an argument with the two strangers after he had been drinking with them in a Kidderminster pub, Worcester Crown Court was told. 
Matthew Arnold, prosecuting, said it had been a friendly conversation until the early hours of February 27 when Eggington became aggressive. 
The two men decided to leave but he followed them out. He headbutted one man in the face and then punched him causing cuts and bruises and when his companion intervened, Eggington punched him in the face as well. 
Other people stepped in and Eggington was arrested. He told police he would &quot;wind himself up&quot; when he had been drinking but he could not remember exactly what had happened. 
Eggington, of Broad Street, Kidderminster, pleaded guilty to two charges of assault by beating. 
Abigail Nixon, defending, said the 19-year-old had been acquitted of rape on February 26 after spending two years in bail and had gone out to celebrate. 
She told the court he now had a young baby and was about to start work as a refuse collector. 
Judge Robert Juckes, QC, said street violence of this kind destroys the security of other people who are out and about on the streets at the time. 
He gave Eggington a custodial sentence of four months. Share:

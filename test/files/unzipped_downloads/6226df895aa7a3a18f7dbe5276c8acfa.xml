NC law makers file bill to replace HB2 WCNC 4:34 PM. EST May 10, 2016 Generic bathroom sign 
RALEIGH, N.C. -- Big developments in the battle over House Bill 2 Tuesday; law makers have filed a bill to replace the law. 
This bill is on top of a bill already filed to repeal the controversial legislation. 
The new bill just filed is called the &apos;Equality for All Act&apos; Bill, and it would replace HB2 altogether will full-non discrimination protections. 
The way House Bill 2 is written right now, it does not give protections to members of the LGBT community and prohibits transgender people to use the bathroom they identify with. 
This new bill would reverse all of that and provide equality for everyone in the state. 
Supporters call it a companion to two other bills that would repeal House Bill 2, both of which are in senate and house committees right now. 
It&apos;s unclear what Governor McCrory and state law makers will do with the newly proposed bill, and there is no timeline in place. 
Governor McCrory has yet to respond to the new bill filed Tuesday.

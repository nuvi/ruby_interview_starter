A Canadian teen made the discovery of a lifetime, and he’s only 15 years old! By studying satellite images to confirm his theory that ancient Mayan cities were built in relationship to constellations, William Gadoury found a lost Mayan city. 
William’s effort took three years, after he developed an interest in the Maya in 2012, the year when their calendar ended, a fact that many saw as predicting the end of the world. As it happened, the world did not end, but young William realized that Mayan cities were built in correlation with constellations, something which did not occur to anyone who has studied the Mayans previously . William made this connection while trying to understand why so many cities were not built on obvious locations like near rivers and coastal areas.

As he told the Journal de Montreal , ”They had to have another reason, and as they worshipped the stars, the idea came to me to verify my hypothesis. I was really surprised and excited when I realised that the most brilliant stars of the constellations matched the largest Maya cities.&quot; 
After analyzing 23 constellations in ancient books (known as the Madrid Codex ), he saw that 117 Mayan cities, including well-known ones like Chichen Itza and Uxmal were lined up with the stars in major Mayan constellations. Digging deeper, William observed that one constellation had three stars, but there were just two related Mayan cities that were found. William set about to find the third one. 
A radar image taken by RADARSAT-2 shows a square, man-made structure in the Yucatan Peninsula jungle. 
By taking advantage of satellite photos from space agencies around the world and Google Earth, he overlaid the star positions with actual locations and found ruins in a remote jungle by the coast of Belize (in the southern Yucatán peninsula, on the Mexico-Belize border). The images reveal what looks like a pyramid (believed to be 86 meters high) and about 30 buildings. If confirmed, this would be one of the largest Maya cities ever found. 
He provisionally named the city K&apos;àak&apos; Chi&apos;, which means &quot;fire mouth&quot;.

William&apos;s work will next be published in a scientific paper, but it has already gone viral, bringing deserved attention to this young Indiana Jones. He hopes to be part of the eventual expedition to unearth the city that he found, which will take place as soon as it finds financing.

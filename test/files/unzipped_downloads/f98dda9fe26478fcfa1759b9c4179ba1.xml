The entire State Senate lined up today behind Senator Simcha Felder’s bill to prohibit the requiring of a permit to sing the National Anthem or recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Felder’s bill followed an outrageous incident where middle school children were ordered to cease singing the National Anthem at a 9/11 memorial event.
“I’m very pleased that my colleagues in the Senate stood strongly behind this common-sense legislation,” said Senator Felder. “It’s a sad statement that a law should be necessary to protect people who want to sing our country’s National Anthem or recite our Pledge of Allegiance. I’m hopeful that the members of the New York State Assembly will embrace this bill as enthusiastically as the Senate just did.”

It’s curious that all other nationals when adding Ameican to their name go by their nationality first followed by the ‘American’ title. eg. Fench American, African American, Italian American, yet when it comes to the Jews it is ‘American Jew’, first comes the American surname. This shows our steadfast loyalty to our host country.

VITAL RAISES $800,000 TO ACCELERATE GOLD EXPLORATION IN BURKINA FASO 
Vital Metals Limited (ASX: VML) is pleased to advise that it has successfully raised $800,000 (before costs) via a share placement to fast-track gold exploration and pre-development activities at its high- grade Kollo Gold Project in Burkina Faso, West Africa. 
The share placement, comprising 72,718,064 shares at an issue price of 1.1 cents per share, is being undertaken to sophisticated and professional investors. The placement is within the Company&apos;s existing placement capacity in accordance with Listing Rules 7.1 and 7.1A. The issue price represents a discount of 10% to the 60-day VWAP of Vital shares on the ASX prior to the trading halt of 9 May 2016. 
Ausdrill, through its subsidiary, African Mining Services (AMS) has been granted preferred drilling contractor status for the Kollo Gold project exploration programme. Ausdrill has extensive experience operating in West Africa and will provide Vital with access to modern, reliable drill rigs, skilled crews and high quality logistical support services.

About Ausdrill 
Ausdrill is a leading ASX-listed mining services group with extensive experience operating in West Africa, and the capability to provide a full range of services to the Kollo Gold Project as the project advances towards development. 
Ausdrill&apos;s subsidiary, African Mining Services, has been operating in Africa for 26 years and has detailed knowledge of the mining and exploration industry in the region, with a head office based in Accra, Ghana and regional underground and open pit offices in Ougadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso. 
African Mining Services provides a full suite of contract mining services in six key African countries, including exploration drilling and drilling sample preparation and processing. 
Through its other subsidiaries, Ausdrill has the capability to meet all of the Company&apos;s future drilling and surface mining needs, as well as underground mining services and design and EPCM capability for processing plants, sample laboratories, procurement and logistics support and explosives supply. 
Management Comment 
Vital&apos;s Managing Director, Mr Mark Strizek, said the Company was very pleased to have secured Ausdrill as a cornerstone investor as it moved to fast track the exploration and evaluation of the Kollo gold project. 
&quot;This represents a significant vote of confidence in our strategy to pursue gold exploration in Burkina Faso as a near-term strategy to unlock value for our shareholders,&quot; he said. &quot;Exploration at Kollo has to date been focused on high-grade, near-surface gold mineralisation which appears to be amenable to open pit mining, opening up the potential for an attractive source of near-term cash-flow.&quot; 
&quot;The proceeds of this placement will be used to test the extents of gold mineralisation along the Kollo trend,&quot; he continued. 
&quot;The alliance with Ausdrill established through this investment gives us access to an accomplished West African mining services group with the capability to support us through all phases of this project as we advance towards development. We look forward to the start of drilling and will provide details in a subsequent update.

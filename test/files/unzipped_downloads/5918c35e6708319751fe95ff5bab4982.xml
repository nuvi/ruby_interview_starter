Philadelphia upgrading radios, helmets with convention grant Posted:   More &gt;&gt; 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Philadelphia is planning to upgrade its emergency radio system and buy some new helmets for its motorcycle unit with some of the millions of dollars it&apos;s getting to host the Democratic National Convention, the mayor&apos;s office said Tuesday. 
The city&apos;s federal security grant for the event will total $43 million, said Mike Dunn, a spokesman for Mayor Jim Kenney. 
The initial spending plan includes more than $8 million for personnel; more than $9.6 million for supplies like batteries for smartphones and motorcycle helmets; and $7.7 million for bigger equipment purchases, including 800 megahertz public safety radios. 
The Office of Emergency Management would not provide a breakdown of how many radios or helmets or other emergency equipment it is buying, citing security reasons. 
Spokeswoman Noelle Foizen said the helmets &quot;will support dignitary transport during the convention.&quot; 
The July 25-28 convention is expected to draw 50,000 visitors. 
Cleveland was given about $50 million for security preparations ahead of the Republican National Convention it is hosting in July. The city plans to buy 2,000 riot-control suits with collapsible batons. 
Cleveland also had put out bids to buy more than 300 sets of long-sleeve jackets, gloves and shin guards. That equipment would serve as riot-control gear for police officers riding bicycles. The city also sought to buy 300 bicycles, 15 motorcycles, 25 sets of tactical armor and enough 3.5-foot-high interlocking steel barriers to cover about three miles. 
The Philadelphia convention&apos;s host committee announced Tuesday it has recruited more than 16,000 volunteers to help out during the event. 
&quot;We are thrilled with the overwhelming level of support we have received so quickly from the Greater Philadelphia community and beyond,&quot; said Kevin Washo, the host committee&apos;s executive director. He said exceeding the goal of 10,000 volunteers shows &quot;residents from across the city, region and country are excited about this event and want to be a part of it.&quot;

He&apos;s not going to join the LDS church, he thinks we&apos;re &apos;aliens&apos;, as in wierdos.If you&apos;re going to be all in for Trump you&apos;d better get used to his true character (and the true character of the people he surrounds himself with and who uphold him) because he&apos;s actually a very crude, lascivious person--and he&apos;s not at all interested in changing.The Trumpsters were warned about his baggage but they didn&apos;t care. I hope they have some ideas for how they are going sell Trump in a general election because people who care about the moral character of their candidate are going to have a difficult time voting for this man and those who don&apos;t like sexists are just going to refuse to vote for him. &quot;...the ultimate most annoying person on this forum, A.120!&quot;

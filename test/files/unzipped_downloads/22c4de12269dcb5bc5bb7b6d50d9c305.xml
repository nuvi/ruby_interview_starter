4 Student Loan Secrets that Everyone should Know 4 Student Loan Secrets that Everyone should Know Michael Lux Blog , Lower Payments , Student Loans Leave a Comment 
Student loans can be quite complicated. Between changes to the law, Department of Education policies, and private sector changes; staying on top of everything isn’t easy. As a result of the constantly evolving student loan system, borrowers often miss out on both warnings and good news. 
Today we will be shedding some light on four concepts that flew under the radar, but are still very important. The idea of co-signer release is more myth than reality 

Many lenders love to add co-signers to a loan. By getting a co-signer on the hook, the lender now has two people legally responsible for the debt… a huge win for them. If a potential co-signer is hesitant to sign on the loan, the lender will point to their co-signer release program. Under this program, co-signers can be released from the loan in as little as a year. 
The problem is that the decision to release the c0-signer is at the sole discretion of the lender. At the point a release is even up for discussion, it means the lender already has your business. There is almost no incentive for a lender to ever grant a release. As a result, lenders will come up with any excuse to deny a release application. Read more… Public service forgiveness isn’t simple 
Public service student loan forgiveness is often treated as a get out of jail free card for borrowers who are in too deep on student loans. It sounds simple enough: work for the government for 10 years, pay your loans on time, and your debt is wiped away. 
Unfortunately, the reality is that the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program has lots of fine print that has left many borrowers shocked to learn years of payments will not count towards forgiveness . The reality is that any borrower chasing after public service forgiveness needs to learn all the details and the fine print. Read more… You don’t have to put up with abuse from Navient or Sallie Mae 
By far the biggest name in the student loan business is Sallie Mae. Last year Sallie Mae split off into another company, called Navient, and Navient picked up where Sallie Mae left off. 
Perhaps the most frustrating experience for any borrower is calling customer support in desperate need of help and being unable to get any answers. Unfortunately, things can get worse, because borrowers are often given the wrong answer. The good news is that there are resources in place to hold Sallie Mae and Navient accountable. These resources are provided by the lenders themselves and the federal government. Read more… 
You are spending too much on your student loans 
If you just pay your bill each month as it comes in the mail, odds are pretty good that you are spending too much on your student debt. 
Better Repayment Plans are available – Government data consistently indicates that borrowers are not on an optimal repayment plan. Part of the problem is that the standard repayment plan is the 10-year plan. Of all the government repayment plans, this is the plans with the highest monthly payment. Borrowers who cannot afford this plan have many other options, included income based payments that could lower their bill to $0 per month, yet many do not sign up. 
Even if you have private loans, there are programs in place for borrowers who are in over their head. These Rate Reduction Programs could help many borrowers, but due to a lack of awareness, many people miss out. 
Lower interest rates are available – If you read the last paragraph and thought that it didn’t apply to you because you are easily making your payments, you could be paying way more interest than necessary. 
When student loans are issued, the borrower has no degree or job, and represents a pretty big credit risk. As a result student loan interest rates can be pretty high. Lenders, including the federal government, realize that not everyone will be able to pay back their loans, so the interest rates are set high enough that they still make a profit even if not everyone pays. 
Once you have a job and a degree, you are much less of a credit risk. In fact, you are a great investment. It is part of the reason that multiple lenders offer consolidation interest rates below 2% . By taking advantage of your improved financial situation it is possible to dramatically reduce your student loan interest rate.

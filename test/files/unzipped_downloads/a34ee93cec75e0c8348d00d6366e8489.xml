Posted May. 10, 2016 at 12:08 AM Updated at 2:39 AM Posted May 10, 2016 at 12:08 AM Updated at 2:39 AM Wedding bells are ringing on Jane the Virgin ! After weeks of planning and dramatic hiccups, Jane ( Gina Rodriguez ) will make a fateful trip down the aisle on next Monday&apos;s (May 16) episode, but you can get a glimpse of the dress she&apos;ll wear when she marries Michael ( Brett Dier ) right now. Jane picked a lace covered A-line dress that greets her shoulders with a little flare in the bottom half. In the first promo image she&apos;s flanked by her grandmother Alba ( Ivonne Coll ) and her mom Xo ( Andrea Navedo ), who look like they can&apos;t be happier for Jane on the big day. Must watch finales: Scoop on your favorite shows However, Jane the Virgin is a telenovela, which means that no big event will run as planned. A second photo released by the CW predicts there will be at least one hurdle before Jane gets to say her vows. At some point, she&apos;ll get stuck with Rogelio ( Jaime Camil ) on the bus -- and she looks pissed! The question is: are they heading towards the wedding or away from it, and why?

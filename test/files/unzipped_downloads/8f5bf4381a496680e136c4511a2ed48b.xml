Belding man breaks probation with Facebook threat Sentenced to year in jail for violation, other crimes Comment Posted May. 10, 2016 at 4:56 PM Posted May. 10, 2016 at 4:56 PM IONIA A Belding man was sentenced to a year in the Ionia County Jail with credit for 255 days served after pleading guilty to larceny in a building and several probation violations on Tuesday. One of the probation violations was when Tyler Shindorf, 22, sent messages on Facebook to the son of the person he stole from that included the phrase “drop dead,” according to Ionia County Probate Judge Robert Sykes. Shindorf said he was sorry for his crimes and said he wanted to get a fresh start when he is released from jail. Sykes, who as a probate judge deals with juvenile cases, said he has talked with Shindorf many times concerning previous offenses. The judge asked why he should believe Shindorf would change his behavior this time. “I&apos;ve done more jail time,” Shindorf said. Ionia County Prosecuting Attorney Kyle Butler said Shindorf will be eligible for jail programs during his remaining sentence. He said those programs might help Shindorf have a better future. “He&apos;s had a very dismal track record on probation,” Butler said. “(But) he&apos;s only 22 years old, we should not give up on him yet.” A man was also arraigned for allegedly stealing more than $1,000 from the Walmart in Ionia. Charles Wilson II, 27, was arrested by the Michigan State Police after allegedly stealing several items on March 24. He is being held in the Ionia County Jail as he awaits a jury trial. Wilson is also charged with illegal possession of the prescription drug Xanax. Follow Nicholas Grenke on Twitter @NickSJ86. Ionia Sentinel - Standard-Ionia, MI

MINNEAPOLIS A Minnesota doctor saw Prince twice in the month before his death, including the day before he died, and prescribed him medication, a search warrant says. 
Dr. Michael Todd Schulenberg treated Prince on April 7 and April 20, and he prescribed &quot;medications and prescriptions&quot; for the musician, according to the warrant, which was filed Thursday in Hennepin County and obtained by KSTP-TV and the Los Angeles Times. 
Investigators interviewed Schulenberg and searched a suburban Minneapolis hospital where he worked. The warrant did not specify what medications were prescribed for Prince or whether he took them. 
Lesa Bader, a spokeswoman for North Memorial Medical Center, said Schulenberg was a primary care physician at its Minnetonka clinic but he no longer works for the health care system. A message left Tuesday at the physician&apos;s home wasn&apos;t immediately returned. 
Prince, 57, died April 21 at his Paisley Park home and studio in suburban Minneapolis. Autopsy results are pending. 
A law enforcement official has told The Associated Press that investigators are looking into whether Prince died from an overdose and whether a doctor was prescribing him drugs in the weeks before he was found dead at his home in suburban Minneapolis. The law enforcement official has been briefed on the investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. 
Carver County Deputy Sheriff Jason Kamerud said the warrant was supposed to have been filed under seal and he had contacted a court administrator to ensure that it was sealed. He said he could not comment on its contents. We welcome your comments on this story, but please be civil.

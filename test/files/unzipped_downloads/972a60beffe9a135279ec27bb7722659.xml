School board meeting on LGBT attracts more than 100 people A state school board meeting has attracted many people who want to comment on proposed guidelines for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students at Michigan&apos;s public schools. Comment Posted May. 10, 2016 at 4:17 PM By The Associated Press Posted May. 10, 2016 at 4:17 PM LANSING, Mich. (AP) — A state school board meeting has attracted many people who want to comment on proposed guidelines for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students at Michigan&apos;s public schools. The meeting Tuesday is part of a public comment period. The guidelines include suggestions that teachers refer to transgender students by preferred pronouns and allow them to use a bathroom corresponding to their gender identity. Passions were high. More than 100 people crammed into a state building, including many stuck near elevators after the meeting room reached capacity. Several Republican lawmakers spoke in opposition. Many critics say they fear men may pose as transgender to prey on girls. Supporters say the guidelines could make schools more welcoming for transgender kids and students who are questioning their gender identity. ___ Guidelines and comments: https://www.michigan.gov/mde/0,4615,7-140-37818_44099-378932--,00.html Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

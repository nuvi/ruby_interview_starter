Bundy sues judge in Nevada standoff case Nevada rancher wants her removed from hearings ASSOCIATED PRESS 
LAS VEGAS — Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy is suing the federal judge handling his criminal case in an armed standoff with government agents — and is naming President Obama, U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, and one of Reid’s sons as defendants, too. 
Bundy’s lawyer, Joel Hansen, told U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro in open court Tuesday that because she’s a defendant in the lawsuit, she should remove herself from Bundy’s case. 
The judge responded that case law doesn’t let a defendant create a conflict like that. 
However, she set a May 25 date to rule whether she’ll step aside. 
Hansen complains the judge won’t let conservative lawyer Larry Klayman represent Bundy in Nevada. 
The lawyers argue that Bundy’s constitutional rights are being violated, and that charges against the 70-year-old cattleman should be dismissed.

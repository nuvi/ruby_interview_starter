John Kasich Will End His Presidential Campaign May 10 By Ron Miles 
&quot;That&apos;s where we have to be because we are going to have a tough campaign against a candidate who&apos;ll literally say or do anything&quot;, she said of Trump. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have dealt with the reality of Trump in their own ways - McConnell has pushed small bills through the Senate while Ryan hopes to push a bold agenda focused on national security, the economy, poverty and health care through the House. 
Trump supporters said he could ease concerns about his lack of experience by choosing a well-known running mate. &quot;We gave it all we got&quot;, Cruz said. 
&quot;Con artist&quot;, said Florida Sen. 
Lanhee Chen, who had advised former Republican candidate Marco Rubio, on Tuesday night floated the possibility of a third-party candidate. 
Asked if he&apos;d now be supporting Trump, Daudt was coy. A first-time candidate, he eschewed traditional fundraising and relied more on his own star power than television advertising to draw attention. 
&quot;It would require personal sacrifice, and I&apos;m not sacrificing for him&quot;, Groover said before the polls closed in IN on Tuesday. &quot;I also don&apos;t believe people will make a decision about who to vote for based on who I&apos;m going to vote for&quot;. 
Both Trump and Clinton are unpopular with voters. 
Though beaten in the latest primary, the &quot;NeverTrump&quot; forces within the Republican Party aren&apos;t backing down from their refusal to support their party&apos;s all-but-certain nominee. 
With Donald Trump&apos;s remaining rivals bowing out of the race, clearing his path to the nomination, Hillary Clinton is looking for ways to woo Republicans turned off by the brash billionaire. 
Libertarians seeking their party&apos;s presidential nomination say Sen. 
If Ayotte is closing ranks behind Trump, it&apos;s a safe bet that most of the party establishment will do the same. It&apos;s just impossible for him to win. &quot;Somebody who can help me get things passed and somebody who is friends with the senators and the congressmen&quot;. And we&apos;ll see what happens. &quot;And if he&apos;s the nominee, of course I&apos;m going to support the Republican nominee&quot;. 
Now Trump is able to take over convention planning, combine staffs with the Republican National Committee, and form a joint fundraising operation. 
But Democrats in his home state feasted, accusing him of &quot;pursuing his presidential ambitions and ignoring the needs of the people of Ohio&quot; and demanding that his campaign tally its cost to state taxpayers so they could be reimbursed. The GOP electorate, fed up with a Republican Party they felt had too often capitulated to Democratic demands, was angry, and Trump became the vehicle for that anger and desire for an outsider candidate. 
Guy Benson, political editor of the conservative website Town Hall and a Fox News contributor, tweeted, &quot;Much to my deep chagrin (&amp; astonishment - 8 months ago), for the first time in my life, I will not support the GOP nominee for president&quot;. With Cruz out of the race, crossing the threshold is a foregone conclusion for Trump. 
While in the office of Secretary of State, she was blasted for alleged incompetence - critics called it negligence - for not providing better security for the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, resulting in the 2012 terrorist attack that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. It was a contrast to Kasich&apos;s prior reputation as a prickly politician, but an even bigger contrast to Trump&apos;s rowdy rallies in large arenas. 
&quot;He is the representative, nationally the representative of their party&quot;. She, however, is anticipated to win Democratic party&apos;s nomination as she is leading Sanders by over 800 delegates. &quot;The more you embrace Trump, the more you turn traditional conservatives and Independents away from you&quot;. 
One legislator firmly in the no-Trump camp is state Rep. Pat Garofalo, R-Farmington. Don Benton of Vancouver, Trump&apos;s campaign chief in Washington. 
Just last week, Garofalo predicted a &quot;Hiroshima-like down ballot disaster if Trump is GOP nominee&quot;. Related:

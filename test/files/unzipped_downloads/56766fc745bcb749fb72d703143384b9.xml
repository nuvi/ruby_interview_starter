Would the feds really cut off money over HB2? House Bill 2 Battle: Would Feds Cutoff Funding? Chad Silber and WFMY News 2 , WCNC 4:21 PM. EST May 10, 2016 WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 9: U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch looks on after announcing federal action related to North Carolina, at the U.S. Department of Justice, May 9, 2016, in Washington, DC.

We’ve heard North Carolina could lose billions in federal funding if the state refuses to back down from the controversial new law commonly known as HB2. 
Would the federal government really cut off North Carolina? 
Here&apos;s what&apos;s at stake. We&apos;re talking billions of dollars and that&apos;s just in education funds. The UNC system gets $1.4 billion a year. Then there&apos;s $800 million in student loans for students at public universities. We could even lose federal department of transportation money. That number could also be in the billions. 
But is it realistic? An Elon Law professor says not really, a lot would need to happen first. 
&quot;The federal government does not stop payment on checks that it&apos;s already cut to states nor does it stop paying staying states federal funds in the absence of a federal court declaration that the state is violating federal law,&quot; said Enrique Armijo, an Elon University Law professor. 
That means a judge would have to decide North Carolina is in the wrong and order the state to get rid of HB2. If North Carolina refused, then the federal government could pull funding. We also wanted to know whether this case could go to the U-S Supreme Court. 
&quot;I think before that happens, I think the legislature in North Carolina will come to the very sensible conclusion that this issue is not worth the billions and billions of dollars that it might cost in terms of federal funding and putting that funding at serious risk,&quot; said Armijo. 
2 wants to know what it will cost you, the taxpayer, to defend the law? 
Karl S. Bowers, Junior, is the attorney listed on the lawsuit filed by the state Monday morning. He&apos;s the same attorney who represented North Carolina in the federal lawsuit about our voter ID law. 
At the time, the Associated Press reported Bowers billed the state at a rate of $360 per hour. Sounds like a lot but that&apos;s actually the going rate in a major metropolitan area. 
Keep in mind, this case could drag out for a while. One law expert said it could be a couple years before this is all said and done.

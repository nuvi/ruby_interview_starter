U.S. Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) said today he will support Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for president to unify the party and defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. 
In a conference call with Ohio news reporters, Mr. Portman said that he has been supportive of Mr. Trump since Ohio Gov. John Kasich dropped out of contention for the GOP nomination last week. 
“Republican voters have made their choice clear and I’m going to be supporting Mr. Trump,” he said. 
“I don’t think it’s the time for us as Republicans to be split. We need to be unified and we need to ensure that we don’t see Hillary Clinton elected, who I think would be terrible for addressing the economic challenge that we face,” Mr. Portman said, bringing up his race against Democrat Ted Strickland in the U.S. Senate election in November. 
He said Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Strickland both believe in “more taxes, more regulations, bigger government… and that America’s place in the world is leading from behind.” 
Because of his high negatives, Mr. Trump is seen by many conservatives as likely to lose the election and hurt down-ticket candidates such as Mr. Portman in the process. 
Mr. Portman portrayed himself as in sync with Mr. Trump on trade issues, citing Mr. Trump’s criticism of currency manipulation by China as a way to make Chinese products cheaper next to American products. 
However, Mr. Portman is a longtime supporter of international free trade agreements, and a mainstay of Mr. Trump’s stump speech is criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the incompetence of American officials in negotiating international trade. 
“I certainly don’t agree with starting a trade war,” which he said would happen if the U.S. implemented Mr. Trump’s threat to impose a tariff on products coming out of Mexico. ”I will certainly defend those trade agreements I voted for,” Mr. Portman said. 
“Regardless of who the candidate at the top is we’re running a really strong independent campaign. I will not agree with Donald Trump on everything,” he said. 
He said two of the statements by Mr. Trump that he disagrees with are Mr. Trump’s intent to bar Muslims from entering the United States and that of Mr. Trump suggesting he would not maintain the full faith and credit of the U.S. behind its debt. 
In response, Strickland campaign spokesman David Bergstein said, &quot;Donald Trump’s ascendancy as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is shining a bright spotlight on the fact that Portman is the best senator China’s ever had. 
“Portman is twisting himself into a political pretzel trying to explain his unabashed, decades-long record of supporting unfair, job-killing trade policies that have shipped hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs overseas,” Mr. Bergstein said.

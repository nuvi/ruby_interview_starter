A former children&apos;s show host who was arrested in California is heading back to Louisiana to face charges stemming from allegations that he sexually abused children during a camping trip in 1979. 
Rapides Parish Assistant District Attorney Brian Mosley says sheriff&apos;s deputies plan to escort 76-year-old Frank John Selas III on a flight back to Louisiana on Thursday. In San Diego, Selas waived his right to challenge a warrant for his extradition. 
In the late 1970s, Selas hosted the &quot;Mr. Wonder&quot; show on KNOE-TV in northern Louisiana. He allegedly fled to Brazil in 1979 after parents accused him of abusing their children on a camping trip in central Louisiana. 
Selas was indicted in February on two counts of aggravated rape and other charges relating to one alleged victim. Related content

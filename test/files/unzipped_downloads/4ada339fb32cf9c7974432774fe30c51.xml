675 Bering Dr, Ste 725, Houston , TX ( map ) 29.761429 -95.478836 
UPDATE: DRONEWORKS had to cancel, but we&apos;ll still have beers and just hang out. :) 
Parking is around back; a security guard is in the main lobby - he can let you up to floor 6. 
Let&apos;s get together for a Space City JS pre-pre-party – not a misspelling :) – and chat drones, have some lightning talks, and more! 
DRONEWORKS Studios is going to be joining us for a special demo of various drones they&apos;ve developed in-house; experiences piloting and demonstrating the use of drones for geological, industrial, and media sectors; and lessons-learned surrounding the FAA drone regulations.

MINNEAPOLIS - A Minnesota doctor saw Prince twice in the month before his death, including the day before he died, according to a search warrant obtained by KARE 11. 
The document also reveals Dr. Michael Schulenberg prescribed the late music icon medication. It states he treated Prince on April 7 and April 20. The prescriptions were filled at a Walgreens. 
Investigators interviewed Schulenberg and searched a suburban hospital where he worked. 
A spokeswoman for North Memorial Medical Center says Schulenberg was a primary care physician at its Minnetonka clinic but he no longer works for the health care system. A message left Tuesday at the physician&apos;s home wasn&apos;t immediately returned. 
The search warrant, filed last week in Hennepin County, was supposed to be sealed however, according to a court spokesperson, it got separated from the seal order. &quot;It should have never been released. It was human error,&quot; the spokesperson told KARE 11. 
On Tuesday evening, authorities were seen at Prince&apos;s Paisley Park complex in Chanhassen. The Carver County Sheriff&apos;s Office said detectives were &quot;revisiting the scene as a component of a complete investigation.&quot; 
Officials at the scene would not respond to questions about what they were doing there. A man wearing a sheriff&apos;s department badge got out of an unmarked vehicles and yelled, &quot;Open the gates!&quot; to the private security company inside. The vehicles then moved through the gates and went around to the door of Paisley Park. A siren briefly sounded, and then the cars disappeared from view. 
Prince died April 21 at his Minnesota home. Autopsy results are pending.

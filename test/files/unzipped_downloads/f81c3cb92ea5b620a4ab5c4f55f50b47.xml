Bryce Harper was unhappy with the home-plate umpire on Monday night — which he expressed before his ejection and after the Washington Nationals’ walk-off win — and now he could pay the price for his actions. Your browser does not support iframes. 
FOX Sports Insider Ken Rosenthal reports Major League Baseball could fine or suspend Harper after reviewing the situation. #Nationals ’ Harper facing fine or suspension for his actions after last night’s game. A player who is ejected is not allowed back on field.

Harper was ejected while in the dugout in the ninth inning, moments before teammate Clint Robinson clubbed a game-winning homer. As the team celebrated the walk-off shot, Harper pointed at the umpire and yelled what he called a “couple choice words.” 
When questioned by reporters afterward, Harper didn’t back down and didn’t seem bothered by the idea of being fined. 
“If I do, I do. I’ll pay it,” he said. “Maybe [the umpire will] get fined, too.” 
Harper, the reigning NL MVP, was walked twice more Monday to bring his total to 15 bases on balls in the past five games. Share this:

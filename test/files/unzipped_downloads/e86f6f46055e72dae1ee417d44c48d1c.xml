  WOMAN IN CONSTRUCTION Published 10.05.2016 under Advertorial According to the National Land Committee, 60% of South African women live in poverty, compared to 41% of men. The construction industry, traditionally known as a male-driven industry, is becoming a more common solution for woman to drive down these figures. With the Africa’s population continually growing at a rapid pace, there is no doubt that the African built environment and its construction industry, and more specifically cement and concrete suppliers, will continue to thrive, offering countless employment opportunities. In celebration of women who have ventured into the construction industry, the annual, Women In Construction Awards, now in its fourth year honours individuals who have played a vital role in the construction industry. The Women In Construction Awards cocktail evening takes place, 10 May 2016 co-located with the African Construction and Totally Concrete Expo at the Gallagher Convention Centre, Johannesburg, South Africa. According to Elsie Snyman, construction industry market intelligence analyst, the construction industry is not only a major contributor to GDP, it is also an important vehicle and stimulus for economic growth and a catalyst for job creation. It is the fastest growing economic sector in South Africa and an economic ripple effect and aids socio-economic development. Obert Chakarisa, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Women in Construction Awards partner, South African Institute of Architects (SAIA), says, “With the advent of democracy in 1994, the incoming government underpinned the importance of ensuring that all professions are opened up for participation by previously marginalised groupings. The architectural profession is amongst those that have lagged behind in terms of implementing real tangible transformation gains. The focus on women in architecture has become such a critical driver in ensuring that the national imperatives related to transformation and in particular where it relates to women are realised in the profession” Manana Khotseng, Director, Rehauwe Construction and Development, South Africa - Winner of the Pioneer in Innovation Award Category, 2015 Women in Construction Awards, says, “As a woman in construction there’s a lot of challenges and to be given a platform to be recongised for the innovative difference you have made is great. Because you don’t get it on site…” Awards being announced on the evening include, Pioneer of Innovation Award, New Starter of the year (Under 30), Most Innovative Women Training programme and Excellence in Career Development. Individuals or organisations interested in learning more about Women in Construction awards and partners of the prestigious event can do so on www.womeninconstruction.co.za . Any questions on the awards can be directed at the Project Director of the Women in Construction Awards, Athi Myoli at athi.myoli@womeninconstruction.co.za Share this

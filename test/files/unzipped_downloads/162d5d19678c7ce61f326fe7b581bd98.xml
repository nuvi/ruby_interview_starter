People turning to crowdfunding for maternity leave If you&apos;re a mom, you know the time spent with your newborn is priceless. --THV11.com 05/10/16 Denise Middleton, THV11 Staff , KTHV 1:43 PM. EST May 10, 2016 While she was grieving, her aunt in California decided to set up a Go Fund Me account to raise money for Raquel and her baby boy, with a goal of $1,500.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (KTHV) - If you&apos;re a mom, you know the time spent with your newborn is priceless. It&apos;s why more and more expectant mothers are turning to crowdfunding sites to help pay for maternity leave. 
“Once you find out there&apos;s life growing inside you, I mean it&apos;s a beautiful feeling,” explained Raquelle Roulette, a first-time mom who was ecstatic to learn she and her boyfriend Heinrich Beck were expecting. The moment she found out, she began planning for their future. &quot;I built my registry and started getting things as cheap as I can as early as I could, and I started saving money.&quot; 
Raquelle knew she&apos;d have to prepare, but there was one thing she wasn&apos;t prepared for. During her first trimester, the father of her unborn child died. 
&quot;Not only was I losing my best friend, an amazing man, but the father of my unborn child. What was I supposed to do? How was I going to raise this kid on my own?” she said. 
While she was grieving, her aunt in California decided to set up a Go Fund Me account to raise money for Raquel and her baby boy, with a goal of $1,500. The money was intended to help Roulette pay for a maternity leave. 
&quot;Between losing the father of the baby and not knowing how my bills are going to be paid when I take this time off—that would be a really big blessing to not have to worry about these kinds of things,” Roulette added. “That&apos;s not what you want to worry about when you become a mom for the first time.&quot; 
America is one of only two countries without guaranteed paid maternity leave. Most large employers offer 12 weeks of unpaid leave. President for Central Arkansas Human Resource Association, Chanta Wells says moms aren&apos;t left with many other options. 
&quot;The employers that do provide short term disability benefits—employees can take the six or eight weeks that they need depending on what the doctor recommends,” Wells explained. Some employers offer anywhere from 50 to 100 percent paid maternity for that time off, and smaller companies may not offer it all. 
When other mothers and fathers were asked how they felt about no guaranteed maternity leave, many said that they think it’s unfair because some women simply haven’t healed enough to work. 
“At the end of the day, it&apos;s a business, and they have bills to pay themselves. I understand that,” said one mother, who said she could understand both sides of the debate. 
In the meantime, donations continue to pour in for moms like Raquelle across the country with the hope that they’ll be granted their healing and bonding time.

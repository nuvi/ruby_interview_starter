  Published 10.05.2016 under Press Releases The variable BESSEY STC toggle clamps combine innovative technology with the highest BESSEY quality. The result is unparalleled on the market. This is because only BESSEY toggle clamps have an extremely large clamping range and adapt automatically to different work piece dimensions within a certain clamping range. The benefits are clear to see: One size of BESSEY toggle clamps replaces multiple competitor sizes and can be used up to 5 times quicker. BESSEY has succeeded in transferring the screw clamp principle of quick adjustment to different opening widths to its toggle clamps. The result is: BESSEY toggle clamps make it possible to clamp different work piece thicknesses, without adjusting the clamping screw manually, with practically the same clamping force. The infinitely variable clamping width for horizontal and vertical clamps is therefore up to 35 mm and for push/pull clamp up to 13 mm. This means enormous time-savings, which pays off even from the very first use. The clamping force can also be adjusted perfectly to the work piece, because not all applications or materials require the maximum clamping force. It is up to 1,100 N for the small series of toggle clamps and up to 2,500 N for the large series. Thanks to an adjusting screw in the joint, the clamping force can be adjusted according to the individual requirements without having to use tools. Furthermore, instead of the usual screw head with rubber covering, all BESSEY toggle clamps have a moving pressure plate with a removable protective cap. This allows even delicate materials such as veneered or painted surfaces to be clamped gently. The STC toggle clamp range from BESSEY contains horizontal clamps with a horizontal, vertical and 90° angled base plate, push/pull clamps with a vertical and 90° angled base plate, as well as vertical clamps with a horizontal base plate. All models offer unbeatable benefits and are therefore practical aids for mould manufacture, fixture fabrication and prototyping, as well as in carpentry “The benefits of Bessey clamps is they are always ready to go the first time and perfect for quick set ups during work piece changes, as they adapt to the work pieces of varying thickness, without manual setting of spindle and with practically the same clamping force,” said Ryan Hunt Sales Director Vermont Sales There clamping range is uncompromisingly versatile, one size of the Bessey toggle clamp replaces multiple competitor sizes simultaneously, due to the extremely large clamping range and the Bessey patented mechanism. They are powerful and gentle, even sensitive to all work pieces, veneered and vanished surfaces can be clamped without any concern, due to the moving pressure plate with removable protective cap and clamping force regulation via an adjustment screw in the joint About Bessey At Bessey, we have a long tradition of producing such innovative, practical product solutions as this. Since the cold drawn steel plant was founded in Stuttgart in 1889, the Bietigheim-Bissingen based company continues to raise the bar in clamping and cutting technology. Currently offering more than 1,600 products, BESSEY has a specific solution for practically every application. Our focus is on precision and durability, convenience and safety. “To stop improving is to stop being good.” This was the motto of company founder Max Bessey and it remains our guiding principle today –in all that we do and produce. This means that we are constantly developing new products and improving existing ones to make the user&apos;s life easier, on the basis of innovative ideas. Such innovations are worthwhile. The history of Bessey 1889 Founding of BESSEY as a bright steel drawing plant in Stuttgart 1936 the production of clamping tools begins. In 1944 Construction of the current parent plant in Bietigheim, 1979 Acquisition of the Ernst DIENER shears factory, thus expanding the BESSEY product range to include ERDI shears. 1984 saw the consolidation of tool and precision steel production in Bietigheim and in 2004 the founding of BESSEY Präzisionsstahl GmbH. In 2005 Company renamed from BESSEY &amp; Sohn GmbH &amp; Co. KG to BESSEY Tool GmbH &amp; Co. KG. 2011 Klaus Fuchs becomes Managing Partner of the BESSEY Group. In 2014 the company celebrated its 125 year jubilee. For more information contact Vermont Sales on 011 314 7711 or visit their web site www.vermontsales.co.za . Bessey clamps are available from leading outlets countrywide for information on your nearest outlet call Vermont Sales on 011 314 7711. Trade enquiries welcome

Posted May. 9, 2016 at 2:09 PM Updated May 9, 2016 at 4:00 PM By TV Guide Posted May 9, 2016 at 2:09 PM Updated May 9, 2016 at 4:00 PM On Monday&apos;s episode of Person of Interest , the hypothetical worst-case scenario becomes a very real crisis, when the rebooted Machine begins to turn on Finch ( Michael Emerson ), Reese ( Jim Caviezel ) and Root ( Amy Acker ). Faced with a foe whose &quot;artificial&quot; intelligence far surpasses their own, Finch and Root have the perfect setup for yet another philosophical discussion. At one point, Finch ponders the question that&apos;s been on all of our minds: What if it comes down to a winner-takes-all Machine-vs.-humans situation? Who will he choose to save? Catch up on all this week&apos;s Mega Buzz! It&apos;s a decision he may have to make sooner than anyone anticipates, after a &quot;glitch&quot; in Machine 2.0 makes Reese a target. Will the Machine have to be destroyed in order to be &quot;fixed&quot;? Our money&apos;s on yes. Now, granted, we&apos;re only on Episode 2 of a 13-episode season. But it&apos;s unlikely this will be the last time this problem comes up. &quot;Out of his fear and his anguish ... Mr. Finch doubles down and finds a solution that is terrible to him in his heart,&quot; Emerson told us ominously before the start of the season. &quot;When no other solution is available, even the roughest-looking idea ... you may have to go with it.&quot; Check out an exclusive sneak peek of Monday&apos;s episode in the clip above.

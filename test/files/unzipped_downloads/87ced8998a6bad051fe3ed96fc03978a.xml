The foods of the season sing in versatile green curry paste; recipes As if they are bursting from the earth, the greenest foods are now everywhere: asparagus and peas, ramps and spring garlic, sorrel and onions, bok choys and young kale, and bright, fresh herbs. A spicy green curry paste is one way to make the most of a lot of them. Comment Special to The Washington Post Salem Gazette Special to The Washington Post Posted May. 10, 2016 at 2:43 PM By Cathy BarrowSpecial to The Washington Post Posted May. 10, 2016 at 2:43 PM As if they are bursting from the earth, the greenest foods are now everywhere: asparagus and peas, ramps and spring garlic, sorrel and onions, bok choys and young kale, and bright, fresh herbs. A spicy green curry paste is one way to make the most of a lot of them. Whir the ingredients together, pack in freezer-friendly containers and you&apos;ll have the basis of a satisfying, fresh-tasting meal. There are many commercial varieties of curry paste, but I wanted to DIY a pantry (freezer) version that would sing with the flavors of the season. Chilies are essential for both the heat and zesty complexity of traditional curries. My preference is for a combination of assertive Thai chilies and familiar, fruity serranos. Remove the peppers&apos; seeds, and the paste is mildly spicy, with a family-friendly zing; if you are a heat-seeker, add some seeds to the mix. If red curries are your preference, substitute small red bird chilies and Fresnos or Chinese long red chilies, each one substantially zippier than their green cousins. I experimented with ingredient ratios until I landed on a curry paste that worked for me. It&apos;s anything but traditional, with all those fresh herbs. After I was satisfied, I went rogue, adding whatever green components caught my eye. One of my recent interpretations included sorrel, its lemony green elevating the sour flavors from the lime zest and juice. A handful of peppery arugula went into another one. I can&apos;t resist adding garlic chives, Chinese chives or chive flowers for their sweet, oniony bite. Curry pastes are a timely pantry addition for fast-to-the-table delicious dinners that take full advantage of whatever green is growing. --- Author Information: Cathy Barrow is author of “Mrs. Wheelbarrow’s Practical Pantry” (W.W.

WASHINGTON — The latest on the 2016 presidential campaign: 
7:30 p.m. 
Donald Trump has won the Republican presidential primary in West Virginia, adding to his claim on the GOP’s nomination. 
The billionaire businessman became the party’s presumptive nominee after his victory last week in Indiana, which led his last remaining rivals to drop out of the race. 
Anne Ashley is a 66-year-old substitute teacher’s aide from Scott Depot, West Virginia. She and her husband Jim say they were supporters of one of those former rivals, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. 
On Tuesday, they voted for Trump. 
Anne Ashley says she thinks Trump is “becoming more aware of the gravity of becoming president and becoming more composed.” 
Jim Ashley says now that Trump is the presumptive nominee, it’s time for him to unify the Republican Party and to bring other candidates that ran against him into the fold. He says Trump “thinks ‘I can do it on my own,’ but he’s wrong.” 
___ 
6:41 p.m. 
Hillary Clinton predicts Republicans will “throw everything including the kitchen sink at me” in the general election, but the Democratic front-runner has a message for them. 
She says, “They’ve done it for 25 years and I’m still standing.” 
Clinton says at a campaign event in Louisville, Kentucky, on Tuesday that she looks forward to debating presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. 
Clinton is urging Kentucky voters to “have a big vote” next week in the state’s presidential primary to help her campaign “get ready to go all the way to November.” 
Clinton was rallying supporters in Louisville shortly before the polls were closing in West Virginia’s primary. She made no mention of the West Virginia race, where she faces Democratic rival Bernie Sanders.

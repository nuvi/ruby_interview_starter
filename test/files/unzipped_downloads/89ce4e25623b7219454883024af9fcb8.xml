Home &gt; Around the Web &gt; Adventures of Johnny Tundra, Cold-Weather Engineer Adventures of Johnny Tundra, Cold-Weather Engineer May 10, 2016 HPAC Engineering Advertisement 
From the pages of HPAC Engineering come the cold-weather adventures of Johnny Tundra. 
A combination of John Wayne and fictional detective Hercule Poirot, Johnny is calm, cool, and irreversibly logical. He travels the Montana countryside, his 15-year-old Basset Hound, Gas Train, by his side, in a 1972 International Harvester Scout, solving heating and cooling problems in some of the most extreme weather the state has to offer. 
Johnny Tundra is the creation of Ron Wilkinson, a former chief engineer for the Architecture &amp; Engineering Division of the State of Montana. His job took him to the far corners of Big Sky Country, where he was exposed to many odd engineering problems related to—not surprisingly—cold weather 
Johnny&apos;s adventures are lovingly illustrated by Ashley Ribblett, a self-described “art nerd” living in Cleveland who “ loves drawing anything and everything sweet and surreal .” In her free time, Ribblett co-runs the Cleveland branch of Dr. Sketchy&apos;s Anti-Art School.

Abuse scandals emerge in Pope&apos;s Latin American backyard Published: 11 May 2016 New developments in Uruguay and Paraguay offer additional confirmation of the global nature of the clerical sex abuse challenge, and appear to show that media exposure leads to the Church cleaning house, reports Crux . 
When the Church in the United States, Australia, and Ireland was hit by sexual abuse scandals during the first decade of the new millennium, many in the global south looked on with dismay, describing it as “an Anglo-Saxon obsession” and a media-driven campaign to discredit the Church. 
Today, it’s far more difficult to deny the widespread scope of the problem, which affects not only the Church but society: According to the Centre for Disease Control in the US, approximately one in six American boys and one in four girls are sexually abused before the age of 18. 
A 2014 report from the United Nations estimated that globally, one in 10 women are abused before they reach their 20s. 
Now the Pope&apos;s own backyard is in the spotlight. In Uruguay, a country with a population of just 3.3 million, the local Church recently received 20 allegations of clerical sexual abuse of minors, something which the Archbishop of Montevideo, Cardinal Daniel Sturla, defined as a “human tragedy.” 
The alleged survivors came forward after Church authorities opened a phone line for people to do so. 
The phone line was opened last month after a general assembly of Uruguay’s bishops, and was motivated in a large part by media buzz generated by the local release of the Oscar-winning movie Spotlight , which portrayed an investigation by the Boston Globe newspaper in 2002 into clerical abuse cover-ups. 
According to Cardinal Sturla, when the allegations came out they “hit the Church,” but today he says the institution is “ready to act,” knowing how to proceed after learning from experiences in other places. 
Bishop Milton Troccoli, auxiliary of Montevideo, said in April that these cases “cause shame and a very strong pain,” adding that the Church would apply a policy of “zero tolerance,” as “Pope Francis has indicated.” 
Bp Troccoli asked for forgiveness, saying “we feel sorrow and shame because being people who’ve promised to serve God and their brothers, [they] committed these abhorrent acts.” 
Yet the Uruguayan bishops, as many others in developing countries, have been late in implementing strong anti-abuse guidelines. Pope Benedict XVI requested that bishops’ conferences around the world do so in 2002, when he was still Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger and heading the Vatican’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. 
Uruguay’s bishops complied only four years ago, and they were among the first in the region to do so.

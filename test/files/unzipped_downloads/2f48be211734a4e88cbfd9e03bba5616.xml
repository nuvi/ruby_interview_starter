There&apos;s no end in sight for NCIS, but Michael Weatherly has decided it’s time for him – and his Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo — to dismount the CBS ratings juggernaut. 
After 13 seasons and more than 300 episodes — hall-of-fame longevity for a TV series — Weatherly has just two shows remaining on TV’s top-rated drama (Tuesday, 8 p.m. ET/PT), which has been renewed through May 2018. 
Not surprisingly, the biggest thing he&apos;ll miss is the people: a cast and crew of more than 200, many of whom go back to JAG, a former NBC (and then CBS) drama, also created by Donald Bellisario, that spawned NCIS. Weatherly and three other cast members — Mark Harmon (team leader Leroy Jethro Gibbs), Pauley Perrette (forensic specialist Abby Sciuto) and David McCallum (medical examiner Donald “Ducky” Mallard) — go back to the two 2003 JAG episodes that planted the seeds of NCIS. 
“One of the special alchemical aspects of the show is that chemistry that we all have. You never quite know when you put a cast together how it’s going to work, if that soufflé will rise. And we did,” Weatherly says. 
As TV&apos;s most-watched drama for the past seven years (it&apos;s averaging more than 20 million viewers, up 9% compared with last season), the actors and their characters have become household names, so much so that &quot;my mom calls me Tony now,&quot; Weatherly says. 
The 47-year-old New York native, married with two young children (and an older son from a previous marriage), doesn&apos;t take for granted the reach of NCIS, which makes up in global audience numbers and fan devotion what it lacks in critical buzz. &quot;To be dismissive of NCIS because you think (only) Republicans or people in the flyover states watch it is to fundamentally misunderstand the show,&quot; he says. &quot;Any thinking person should pay attention to why a band sells 100 million albums or a TV show is No. 1 in the world.&quot; 
Despite such rare job security, Weatherly has been thinking for some time that it made sense for Tony — and him — to depart. That feeling became stronger after 2013&apos;s departure of Cote de Pablo, who played colleague and former Mossad agent Ziva David. Her romantic chemistry with Tony captivated fans, even if it never became a full-on relationship. 
After de Pablo’s Ziva left, with an emotional goodbye to Tony, “I felt that the character had come to a cul-de-sac development-wise, and I was searching to see if there was some other way to do it,” Weatherly says. “While other characters grew and expanded, it became clear, not just to me, that DiNozzo had maybe (reached) the point where he needed to go on the next adventure.” 
Before DiNozzo leaves, however, expect the season&apos;s last two episodes to be a very special goodbye for a character who dubbed himself a &quot;very special agent.&quot; 
Executive producer Gary Glasberg says he&apos;s lucky to have had months to plan for DiNozzo’s departure, which is intertwined with a continuing story line about an escaped British prisoner on the hunt for NCIS agents. 
“It’s a big deal to lose this character,&quot; he says. &quot;Michael is a warm, generous person who has been a huge part of our lives. We want to give fans the most memorable episode we can. All the characters in this finale have some really wonderful moments with Tony.&quot; 
Glasberg promises Tony-related guest stars, including Robert Wagner as Anthony DiNozzo Sr., will appear in the May 17 episode. Wagner and Weatherly, who played Wagner in the 2004 TV movie The Mystery of Natalie Wood, became friends on the show. 
&quot;It was his idea to have me play his father&quot; on NCIS. &quot;I&apos;m very grateful for that,&quot; Wagner says. &quot;We spend a lot of time offstage together. We are very much alike. It&apos;s not difficult for me to love him and be his father.&quot; 
Don&apos;t expect a new Ziva sighting, however: De Pablo told a Massachusetts college audience last month that she would not be returning for DiNozzo&apos;s sendoff. Glasberg, interviewed before de Pablo&apos;s comments, won&apos;t confirm her absence but says, “I&apos;ll certainly say that Tony’s relationship with Ziva absolutely has an impact on his reason to leave.” 
In teasing the finale, Weatherly acknowledges his and Tony&apos;s shared interest in film history, saying he used two movie characters — Jack Nicholson&apos;s Bobby Dupea from 1970&apos;s Five Easy Pieces and Peter O&apos;Toole&apos;s King Henry II in 1964&apos;s Becket — as inspiration for his performance. 
Tony &quot;is more alive in this episode in a human way than I&apos;ve seen him in quite some time. I was very excited every day to do things that DiNozzo had never done before, and he had done a lot,&quot; he says. 
NCIS already has begun evolving for a post-DiNozzo era, as seen in the growing camaraderie between newer agent Ellie Bishop (Emily Wickersham) and Timothy McGee (Sean Murray), who&apos;s in line to become senior agent under Gibbs years after being hazed as an NCIS rookie by Tony.

Over the years, DiNozzo and McGee&apos;s brotherly scuffling became a core relationship on NCIS, revealing the characters&apos; personalities while highlighting the show&apos;s trademark humorous banter. 
&quot;Tony and McGee have always counted on each other. The strong suits of McGee are the weak suits of Tony, and vice versa,&quot; Murray says. &quot;Tony is a big part of what made McGee who he is now. It&apos;s kind of the way it was meant to be.&quot; 
The season&apos;s final two episodes, airing May 10 and 17, introduce two new characters, FBI agent Tess Monroe (Sarah Clarke) and British MI-6 officer Clayton Reeves (Duane Henry), both potential series regulars. 
Viewers may not have to go into full Weatherly withdrawal: The actor shot a drama pilot, Bull, inspired by Phil McGraw&apos;s pre-Dr. Phil work as a trial consultant, advising lawyers about jury selection and witness preparation. CBS will announce the new show&apos;s fate as early as this week.

Posted May. 10, 2016 at 2:09 PM Updated at 4:06 PM Posted May 10, 2016 at 2:09 PM Updated at 4:06 PM With only two more episodes to go before the end of Season 1 of Blindspot , we&apos;re finally starting to get some solid explanations for the mysterious tasks Oscar ( Francois Arnaud ) assigned Jane ( Jaimie Alexander ) -- and their disastrous consequences. Which begs the question: Is Jane that dense? At the end of the episode, Jane realizes that all those little errands she ran for her ex-fiancé -- planting the GPS tracker, swapping Mayfair&apos;s pen, etc. -- were part of a master plan to frame Mayfair ( Marianne Jean-Baptiste ) for the murder of Tom Carter and its subsequent cover-up. We&apos;re still not sure why Oscar &amp; Co. (conspicuously absent this week) are targeting Mayfair and the FBI. But the hour concludes with Mayfair in handcuffs, facing what will likely be a life sentence in prison without the possibility of parole -- if she&apos;s lucky -- after she gets charged for murdering Alexandra , because her fingerprints were at the crime scene. I mean, that one&apos;s pretty easy to get out of -- Mayfair was just trying to help, until she realized Alexandra had bled out. U.S. Attorney Matthew Weitz ( Aaron Abrams ) reveals that &quot;Alexandra&quot; is also Donna Holloran, a disgraced private eye-turned-fixer who&apos;s been under investigation for the better part of a decade. He lays out a pretty airtight case that Mayfair contacted Holloran to ask for help in covering up Tom Carter&apos;s murder, after Mayfair turned on Carter, worried that he would expose the undercover operation they were both involved in with Saul Guerrero. Finale Preview: Get scoop on Blindspot and more shows We can see Jane start to feel physically ill as she connects the dots between her own actions, which led to the discovery of Tom Carter&apos;s body, and the accusations Weitz levels against Mayfair. But she can&apos;t be that surprised, can she? Seriously, what did she think was going to happen with her obeying Oscar&apos;s orders like a trained puppy? Page 2 of 2 - And the kicker? It&apos;s not only Jane who&apos;s apparently betrayed Mayfair. Weitz says he also found cash in Donna&apos;s apartment, the exact same amount Mayfair withdrew from her account to give to Sofia, with Mayfair&apos;s fingerprints on the bills. Weitz concludes that this is the fee Mayfair paid Donna for covering up Tom Carter&apos;s murder. The only remaining questions are how Jane will react the next time she sees Oscar, and whether he&apos;ll somehow be able to lure her back to his side and get her to trust him again. I&apos;m guessing &quot;it&apos;s not going to be pretty&quot; and &quot;probably.&quot; Blindspot airs Mondays at 10/9c on NBC. Other Links From TVGuide.com

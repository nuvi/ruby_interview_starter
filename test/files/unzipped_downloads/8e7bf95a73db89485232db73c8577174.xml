CINCINNATI The Bengals players who led their playoff meltdown against the Steelers are trying to transfer the edgy rivalry to soccer. 
Suspended linebacker Vontaze Burfict and cornerback Adam &quot;Pacman&quot; Jones are among seven Bengals players who will be honorary captains for FC Cincinnati&apos;s game on Saturday against the Pittsburgh Riverhounds of the United Soccer League. The game will be played at the University of Cincinnati. 
Burfict drew a three-game suspension after hitting Steelers receiver Antonio Brown in the head in the closing seconds. Jones then was penalized for bumping an official, moving Pittsburgh in range for the winning field goal in their first-round game at Paul Brown Stadium last season, the Bengals&apos; record fifth straight opening-round loss.

Delta governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, said his administration has commenced action on measures for boosting the revenue of the state through enhance internal sources. He said that when the measures would “germinate’’, the economy of the state would be impacted positively and development would flourish. The governor stated this while addressing Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) faithful at the state congress of the party in Asaba on Tuesday. He lauded the peaceful conduct of the congress and pledged his commitment and support to the new executive committee of the party in the state. He commended the out-gone executive for “job well-done and for guiding the party aright’’ and urged the people to continue to partner and pray for the state government and PDP.“In a very successful and peaceful congress, we have been able to elect 27-member state executive of the party.“I must congratulate all PDP faithful, who came from all the 25 local government areas and 270 wards in the state,” he said. Okowa charged leaders and communities to appeal to their wards and youths to stop attacking oil facilities and embrace peace. He stated that government would soon establish youth and women liaison offices in various wards across the state to enable them to monitor government projects and gather intelligence in the communities. In the congress, Mr Kingsley Esiso from Delta Central Senatorial District emerged chairman of the party while Godday Nzete from Delta North was elected State Secretary. Other members of the 27-member executive include Val Arenyenka, Deputy Chairman; Moses Iduh, Vice Chairman (Delta North); Mr A.P. Fovie, Vice Chairman (Delta Central) and Mr Emma Agbdugha, Vice Chairman (Delta South). In his acceptance speech, Esiso thanked the delegates for giving him and his colleagues the opportunity to lead the party in the state. He said though the position came with its challenges, he would ensure justice, fairness and equity in running the business of the party, adding that the party belonged to all and not to a section. Earlier, his predecessor, Mr Nwike Uzor, had urged the new executive to ensure continuity of peace in the PDP in the state, describing it as a “family’’. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the congress was conducted by Mrs Uzor Nwadu-led Electoral Committee from PDP headquarters in Abuja. Share with friends:

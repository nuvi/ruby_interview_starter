Mainstreet Health Investments Inc., an owner of U.S. seniors facilities, is seeking to raise US$95 million by selling shares in Canada and listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
Mainstreet Health aims to sell shares for US$10 to US$11 apiece, and it’s targeting an annual dividend yield of 7 per cent to 7.4 per cent, the Toronto-based company said in a May 9 filing with regulators. The sale is being led by Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada. Related Early bird special? REITs gear up for surge in seniors residence demand 
Mainstreet Health, created through a reverse takeover of Kingsway Arms Retirement Residences Inc., owns 10 senior housing and care properties around Chicago and plans to use the proceeds of the sale to buy 13 new properties in Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana and Kansas, according to the filing. 
Canada is having one of its best years for equity financing, with $19 billion announced, and its worst year for initial stock sales, with no corporate IPOs so far and few on the horizon.

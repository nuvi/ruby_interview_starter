Clinton, Sanders battle for West Virginia in Tuesday&apos;s only competitive primary Ted Cruz may resurrect campaign if he somehow beats Republican front-runner Donald Trump in Nebraska The Associated Press Posted: May 10, 2016 7:00 PM ET Last Updated: May 10, 2016 7:33 PM ET While Bernie Sanders, right, is still attracting thousands to rallies, his campaign has grown more difficult as Hillary Clinton closes in on the Democratic presidential nomination.

Voters in West Virginia and Nebraska are casting primary ballots today, but the only competitive presidential race that remains in the Democratic contest tonight is unfolding in West Virginia. 
With Nebraska&apos;s Democrats having caucused in March — giving Bernie Sanders a comfortable win over Hillary Clinton — the state&apos;s Republicans went to the polls Tuesday with their party&apos;s presidential race all but sewn up by businessman Donald Trump after clearing the Republican field of rivals in Indiana last week. A Republican primary was also held in West Virginia, which Trump handily won. 
ANALYSIS Time for Trump, Republicans to come together — somehow: Keith Boag 
The headline race in West Virginia is between Clinton and Sanders. 
Clinton leads Sanders in pledged delegates 1,705 to 1,415, according to The Associated Press, but including her superdelegates, or Democratic Party insiders who can back whomever they want, she is just 155 delegates short of the 2,383 she needs to secure the nomination. To win them, she needs just 17 per cent of the delegates at stake in the remaining contests. 
That means she could lose all the states left to vote by a landslide and still emerge as the nominee, so long as all of her 523 superdelegates continue to back her. Sanders has support from 39 superdelegates. Nebraska&apos;s Republicans went to the polls Tuesday with their party&apos;s presidential race all but sewn up by businessman Donald Trump.

Still, Sanders is vowing to fight on. He campaigned in California on Tuesday for the state&apos;s June 7 primary. 
While Sanders is still attracting thousands to rallies, his campaign has grown harder as Clinton closes in on the nomination. His fundraising has fallen off and so, too, has his advertising, with only about $525,000 US in ads planned for California and $63,000 each in West Virginia and Oregon, according to advertising tracker Kantar Media&apos;s CMAG. 
That&apos;s a significant decline from the wall-to-wall advertising campaign he ran earlier in the primary, during which his $74 million in ads outspent Clinton by $14 million. Clinton looking past Sanders, toward Trump 
Even as the primaries continue, Clinton has largely shifted her focus to the general election. On Monday, she courted suburban women in Virginia and on Tuesday, in Lexington, Ky., she released a proposal to ensure families don&apos;t spend more than 10 per cent of their income on child care. 
Clinton&apos;s campaign hopes suburban women, turned off by Trump&apos;s bombastic rhetoric, could be a key source of support for her in the fall. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who suspended his nomination bid last week, said he is not ready to endorse Trump as nominee and may rejoin the race if he somehow wins Nebraska. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) 
But she&apos;s also trying to stop Sanders from gaining the psychological advantage of a series of wins this month. Her team went up with a $160,000 ad buy in Kentucky on Tuesday, a modest effort aimed at cutting into Sanders&apos; support before the state&apos;s primary in a week. 
Democrats also held a primary election Tuesday in Nebraska, although the party allocated all its delegates to the summer nominating convention in an earlier caucus won by Sanders. 
In an interview with Glenn Beck, Texas Senator Ted Cruz said he is not ready to endorse Trump as nominee, saying he wants a president &quot; we can trust … with power who demonstrates a temperament not to abuse that that power.&quot; 
Cruz, who suspended his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last week, still has his name on Nebraska&apos;s ballot and said if he somehow wins the state and suddenly sees a path to the nomination, his campaign could be back on track.

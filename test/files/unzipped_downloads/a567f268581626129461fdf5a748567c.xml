ESPN&apos;s top two English-language announcing teams will call all their games from France during this summer&apos;s European Championship. 
In 2012, only the No. 1 team called all its matches from Poland-Ukraine, with the No. 2 team going on site starting with the quarterfinals. ESPN called 17 of the 31 matches remotely four years ago and has yet to announce the number for 2016. 
Top play-by-play announcer Ian Darke will work with Taylor Twellman or Steve McManaman. On the No. 2 team, Jon Champion will be joined by analyst Stewart Robson. 
ESPN said Tuesday that former U.S. defender Kate Markgraf will become the first woman to serve as a color commentator for a top-tier international men&apos;s soccer competition on U.S. television. 
The No. 1 Spanish-language team of Fernando Palomo and Tato Noriega will also call matches from France for ESPN Deportes. The No. 2 team of Ricardo Ortiz and Argentina World Cup champion Mario Kempes will be on site starting with the quarterfinals. 
The other English-language play-by-play announcers are Derek Rae, Adrian Healey, Max Bretos and Mark Donaldson. Analysts are Alejandro Moreno, Tommy Smyth and Paul Mariner. 
The other Spanish-language play-by-by announcers are Omar Orlando Salazar, Emilio Fernando Alonso and Jorge Ramos, while Roberto Gomez Junco, Ricardo Mayorga and Hernan Pereyra are the analysts. Related content

Posted May. 10, 2016 at 10:08 AM Updated at 1:26 PM Posted May 10, 2016 at 10:08 AM Updated at 1:26 PM &quot;Kate Beckett is going to be dead by the end of the night and there&apos;s nothing you can do about it.&quot; That&apos;s what a mysterious villain threatens in the promo for Castle &apos;s eighth season finale. The May 16 episode will see Castle ( Nathan Fillion ) and Beckett ( Stana Katic ) taking on LokSat, but a twist during their investigation will put both their lives at risk. However, seeing that Fillion has already signed a deal to return for a potential ninth season, it&apos;s really only Beckett fans should be worried about. Katic was let go by ABC due to budgetary reasons, along with series regular Tamala Jones . The network has yet to make a decision whether it will be renewing or canceling Castle , but producers filmed two alternate endings for the season finale, one of which could double as a series finale. &quot;In a worst-case scenario, there&apos;s an additional scene we won&apos;t say much about that exists in case they tell us we&apos;re not coming back,&quot; co-showrunner Alexi Hawley tells TVGuide.com . Do you think Castle will kill off Beckett? The Castle finale airs Monday, May 16 at 10/9c on ABC. Other Links From TVGuide.com

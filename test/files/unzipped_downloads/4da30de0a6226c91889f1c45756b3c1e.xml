NEW YORK — A day after giving up a career-high five home runs, Royals pitcher Chris Young said he will return to Kansas City on Wednesday to have an MRI on his right forearm. 
The right-hander, who started and won last year&apos;s World Series opener, is 1-5 with a 6.88 ERA and has given up 13 homers in seven starts and 32 1/3 innings this season. He told the Royals after Tuesday&apos;s loss to the New York Yankees that he has been bothered by inflammation in his forearm. 
&quot;I&apos;ve had to change the way I take off my shoes, the way I brush my teeth, the way I take off my shirt,&quot; the 6-foot-10 Young said Tuesday. &quot;But throwing does not bother it, which is I think why it&apos;s been a little bit hard to address.&quot; 
Young, who turns 37 on May 25, will be examined by team physician Dr. Vincent Key. Young said he began to feel a problem with the forearm late in spring training. 
&quot;It&apos;s just been lingering. No real improvement, but it hasn&apos;t gotten worse. I think for me the ability to finish a pitch is extremely important,&quot; he said. &quot;The ball&apos;s coming out great, but there&apos;s no life there.&quot; 
Young has given up nine home runs in his last three starts. While his fastball has averaged 88 mph, up 1 mph from last year, the lack of late movement has hurt him. 
Royals manager Ned Yost Head said athletic trainer Nick Kenney had not mentioned anything, and &quot;Nick does not inform me of things unless he&apos;s worried about it.&quot; Yost said the tests were being done &quot;more for Chris&apos; frame of mind.&quot; 
&quot;I don&apos;t have a major concern because he has been able to deal with it,&quot; Yost said.

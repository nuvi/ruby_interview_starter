Home Entertainment 9 of Prince Harry&apos;s Sweetest, Most Inspirational, Totally Badass Moments at the Invictus Games 9 of Prince Harry&apos;s Sweetest, Most Inspirational, Totally Badass Moments at the Invictus Games Like Reasons one million through one million and nine that we love Prince Harry. The 31-year-old royal was out and about in Orlando, Florida, over the weekend for the Invictus Games — the Paralympic-style, multi-sport event for service members and veterans he created in 2014 — and, as always, Harry was absolutely charming and hilarious and adorable wherever he went. 1. Like when he tried to eat Jaco van Gass’s gold medal. That’s not a chocolate coin, Harry!

Photo: Getty Images Fun fact: That’s British gold winner in recumbent cycling, Rob Cromey-Hawke, and his daughter, whose name is Pippa! What a coincidence! Harry recently came face-to-face with a 9-year-old who wanted to know if he is ever going to be king. Watch the hilarious interaction in the video below.

Account A 20 Year Old With Down Syndrome Opened His Own Business. 
He’s also the youngest business owner in his town! Cool, inspiring, heart warming and just all sorts of awesome!! 
There’s a 20-year-old named Blake Pyron, who lives in Sanger, Texas, just outside Dallas, and he has Down syndrome, but he hasn’t let it stop him. He worked at a barbecue joint while he was in high school, but it went out of business recently. Then he couldn’t find another job, but he missed talking to customers, so he decided to open his OWN business 

Meet Blake and check out his inspiring story HERE. 2016-05-10

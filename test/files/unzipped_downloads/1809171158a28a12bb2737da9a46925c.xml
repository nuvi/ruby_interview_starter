Los Altos: Council wants advice on picking city manager By John Orr Posted: 05/10/2016 03:47:51 PM PDT Updated: 05/10/2016 03:54:27 PM PDT Click photo to enlarge Chris Jordan comes from West Linn, Ore., to take over as interim city manager of Los Altos. His contract runs through September of this year. « 1 » LOS ALTOS -- The city of Los Altos is seeking input from the community on its search for a city manager. 
Marcia Somers resigned from the job in April, and the City Council appointed Chris Jordan, former city manager of West Linn, Ore., as interim city manager, effective April 27. Jordan&apos;s contract runs through Sept. 30, or until a permanent city manager is selected. 
On Tuesday, the City Council announced that it has hired Bob Murray &amp; Associates to lead the search for a permanent city manager, and that it has launched an online survey to see what &quot;residents, businesses and other community stakeholders&quot; would value most about the next city manager. 
Los Altos leaders were criticized last year over a ballot measure that would have raised money to upgrade the city&apos;s community center. After the measure was defeated, residents criticized the City Council for not making a greater effort to find out what residents wanted and were willing to support financially. 
Now, the council is making no bones about seeking community input. 
&quot;This survey was designed to help both the City Council and recruiter understand the characteristics community members value most in their civic leader,&quot; Los Altos Mayor Jeannie Bruins said in a news release. 
The survey can be found at http:// bit.ly/cm_survey, and will be available until July 1. Advertisement

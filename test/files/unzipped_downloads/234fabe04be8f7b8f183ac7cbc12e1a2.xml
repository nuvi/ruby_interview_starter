ANDERSON, S.C. — Army veteran Charlie Pannell, who lost his left leg after being hurt in Iraq, died of complications related to his service injury, the Anderson County Coroner said Monday. 
Pannell, 35, was found unresponsive Sunday morning by his wife, Bethany. She had just fed the couple&apos;s 8-month-old son, Garrett, before checking on her husband. 
Coroner Greg Shore said an autopsy Monday revealed that Charlie Pannell had a partial bowel obstruction and that he aspirated in his sleep. 
&quot;This is all tied to his war injuries,&quot; Shore said. &quot;It is just tragic and unexpected.&quot; New VA watchdog pledges more transparency 
Pannell was injured by an explosion in Mosul in September 2008. Since then, the Independent Mail has chronicled volunteers&apos; efforts to make his home more accessible and reported on Pannell&apos;s hopes to compete in the Paralympic Games. 
Funeral arrangements had not been finalized as of Monday, according to a spokesman for McDougald Funeral Home in Anderson. 
Pannell worked at Upstate Warrior Solution, a non-profit organization that acts a clearinghouse to help veterans get services and benefits. He was an outreach specialist and met with other veterans to help determine their needs, said Paul Howell, a spokesman for the organization. 
&quot;He truly did whatever he could to help others,&quot; Howell said. &quot;We remain grateful for his service.&quot; Veterans could go anywhere for care under McCain bill 
Charlie Hall, the organization&apos;s executive director, said Pannell volunteered there before joining the staff about two years ago. 
&quot;He used his own experiences and challenges to reach other veterans in his community in order to be a catalyst for their growth and development as members of this community,&quot; Hall said. &quot;Charlie, his wife, Bethany, and their three children have been, and continue to be, a special part of the Upstate Warrior Solution team.&quot; 
Pannell had undergone more than 100 surgeries since his injury, including a recent one to prepare him for a new prosthesis. 
He was discharged from Greenville Hospital System on Saturday, just hours before his death.

So, this &apos;wheat&apos;...are they the ones who try to find imaginative ways to not have to pay a full tithe, who want to be able to drink beer or have a glass of wine when they feel like it? Or think it&apos;s restrictive to not be able to go to the movies or shop on Sunday? Do they complain about garments getting in the way of their style or are annoyed that the Prophet said they shouldn&apos;t get tatoos or wear more than one earring? Are they the ones who gripe about their church leaders and complain about other members? Are they the ones who think the church is out of touch for speaking out against gay marriage and pornography? Are those the &apos;wheat&apos; we are talking about?Cause, I&apos;ve seen some of these people who think they are the &apos;wheat&apos; and would probably agree that they&apos;ve been pushed out of the church by the &apos;tares&apos;. Personally, I&apos;d rather stay with the &apos;tares&apos; than join those so-called &apos;wheat&apos;. I checked. Jesus gets to decide who the wheat is. We&apos;ll just have to wait until we die to find out which one we are. In the meantime, I&apos;ll not worry about anyone else. I&apos;m no John Wayne. I&apos;m Charles Ingalls from Little House. He is all that&apos;s good in this country. He loved his God and neighbor. We need millions of Ingalls&apos;s. I&apos;m going to be the simple man and hope that ‪a few John Wayne&apos;s bring the Cavalry with them.

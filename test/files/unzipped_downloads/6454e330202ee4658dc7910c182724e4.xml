Cologuard competitor is no big threat, Exact Sciences CEO says 
Exact Sciences Corp. CEO Kevin Conroy says he doesn&apos;t think the launch of a competing product on Monday will put much of a dent into sales of Cologuard, the Madison 
Laboratory Corp. of America ( LabCorp ) said it will offer Epi proColon, a blood test for colorectal cancer screening developed by the German company 
LabCorp -- parent company of Covance, one of Madison&apos;s largest private employers with nearly 2,000 employees here -- is one of the world&apos;s biggest health care diagnostics companies. It is the first U.S. lab to offer Epi proColon since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
Cologuard was 90 percent accurate in identifying those without colorectal cancer in a 
Epigenomics&apos; test also was less sensitive in recognizing cancer cells, said 
On top of that, Medicare will not reimburse the cost of Epi proColon at this time and major insurance companies generally wait until that happens, Elliott said. Cologuard won Medicare coverage at the same time as FDA 
Cologuard and Epi proColon went before the FDA

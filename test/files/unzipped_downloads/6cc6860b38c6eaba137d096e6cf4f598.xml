Last year I signed up to cashback website I Love Cashback, which offered cash rewards if you used its site as a portal to various online shopping sites. I shopped through retailers like Homebase, Argos and Evans and amassed a small cashback pot of £51. 
I’ve tried to access this pot since the beginning of the year and was promised payment within 30 days. That was in February. Since then my repeated queries to the site have gone unanswered, and the website says it is currently offline pending the outcome of discussions underway with third parties. 
“Please be assured that we are completely committed to successfully resolving the current situation, but due to the suspension of trading, we are unable to respond to support tickets.” 
Do you think there’s any chance of getting my money out of these people? NS, London 
The simple answer is no, you almost certainly will not be seeing your £51, as it looks as though the company has ceased trading. The website has been promising an update for several weeks, and if it is to be wound up then you and others are unlikely to be paid, as you will find yourself at the bottom of a list of creditors. A little research shows that customers were complaining about delays in being paid cashback as far back as 2014. In our view it rarely makes sense to change a buying decision because of offered cashback. In too many cases the promised money fails to arrive.

&quot;Ceased trading&quot;? That doesn&apos;t mean anything except they&apos;ve stopped paying out, which we know already. The company behind this, ORS Global Ltd, is still alive and kicking at Companies House, despite being around £500k in the red. It was first set up about 5 years ago, as an interesting venture between entities based in Jersey and the BVI, and has lost about £100k each year since, whether it&apos;s been trading or not. In short, it&apos;s done comparatively well.
One of the great virtues of British commercial life is that anyone can set up a company and fly it into a metaphorical mountain. It is almost expected for businesses to run entirely on credit - which is why, shocked by Woolworths, the government printed lots of money for banks to lend to businesses. Even if the banks balk, there&apos;s no shortage of money elsewhere in the global economy in need of shuffling. Behind the scenes, the shareholders or private companies can shovel out as much in dividends and salaries as they can, until it&apos;s time to shutter the operation (paying off the major creditors first, especially if they&apos;re themselves), and start again. Each time, it&apos;s the customers, the staff, the small suppliers that get stung, but that&apos;s surely reflects on the right and natural order of things.
This isn&apos;t a scam. This is a legal entitlement. We can all do this, if we happen to know the right people, with the right connections. Any of us can set up or buy any company we like, no questions asked, with nothing but a alleged line of credit, no matter how many bankruptcies lie behind us. Even better, we can then pay ourselves what we like and, if things get tricky, shutter the outfit and start again. That is entrepreneurship in the &apos;knowledge economy&apos;, and what keeps Britain&apos;s economy one of the largest in the world, despite few natural resources and moribund productivity.
Hence the answer above. They&apos;ve chosen to &apos;cease trading&apos;, so hard cheese. But you can comfort yourself with this thought. It is thanks to millions of consumers, people like you and me, that Great British Business can carry on leading the way in the global economy, fostering companies that even Panamanian formation agents wouldn&apos;t touch; and that our losses are, in a very real sense, someone else&apos;s gain.

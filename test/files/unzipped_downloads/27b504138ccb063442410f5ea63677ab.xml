Delgado: &apos;Committed to a cleaner, healthier Reno&apos; Oscar Delgado 2:53 p.m. PDT May 10, 2016 Oscar Delgado (Photo: Provided to the RGJ) 
Less than four years ago I was elected to represent our community on the Reno City Council. I have fought tirelessly to tackle blight in our community. I advocated for increased code enforcement, organized multiple community cleanups, and reached out to owners of numerous blighted properties to encourage improvements for the betterment of the entire city. 
I’ve accomplished some important goals since 2012 and now as your vice mayor, I am more committed than ever to making sure that we continue our effort for a cleaner and healthier Reno. 
Your city government is aware of the need to address blight, affordable housing, and river encampments around the downtown core. Of course, we all know that every great city needs a great downtown, but we can’t forget about our neighborhoods and communities where people spend the majority of their time.

Blight not only affects the aesthetics of a city, it affects our health. As it stands, people living in low-income households are much more likely to suffer from poorer health outcomes. In addition, recent data suggests that people living in impoverished neighborhoods are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases, which in turn leads to a much lower quality of life. No one is more negatively impacted than children and seniors living in these communities, which is why I have made it my personal mission to work with my colleagues at City Hall to improve conditions in neighborhoods throughout the city. 
The people of Reno deserve a cleaner, healthier city and that is why we recently launched the Reno Blight Initiative. For this initiative, I worked with the mayor, City Council, and city management to set aside $1 million specifically to address trash and homelessness concerns along the river, clean up graffiti, revitalize condemned buildings, clean up our sidewalks, and much more. 
We’ve also created a Neighborhood Renewal Grant program, which allows homeowners in qualified areas the ability to apply for a grant to help improve their neighborhood by removing blight, painting structures and improving landscapes, among other things. 
Ultimately, my hope is that we will be able to continue on the great work that we’ve done over the past four years, and make Reno one of the healthiest and most vibrant cities in the entire country in the years to come. People shouldn’t have to feel different or be subjected to a lower quality of life simply because of the zip code they live in. 
Fighting blight takes a constant effort and I will continue my commitment to building #NeighborGood and making Reno cleaner and healthier for us all.

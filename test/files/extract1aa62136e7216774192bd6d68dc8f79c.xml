2d Pens&apos; rookie&apos;s overthrow of King Henrik, Mason&apos;s miscue and a bruising Blackhawks-and-Blues rivalry among top playoff moments comment print comment 
From Pittsburgh Penguins rookie Matt Murray standing on his head to the San Jose Sharks (finally) standing tall, the Chicago Blackhawks veterans rebounding from a few body blows from the St. Louis Blues to Philadelphia Flyers goalie Steve Mason &apos;s massive, series-altering misplay against the Washington Capitals , our writers weigh in on the most memorable performances -- good and bad -- they&apos;ve seen during the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs so far.

Perhaps the most lasting memory of the first round was the juxtaposition of the goaltending fates of the New York Rangers and the Pittsburgh Penguins . 
Seeing Matt Murray , all of 21 years old, slide into the middle of the series for Pittsburgh and simply close the door on the Rangers was a revelation. After he sat out the first two games of the series because of a concussion he&apos;d sustained in the last game of the regular season, Murray allowed just four goals in three games against New York -- all victories. His demeanor and humility were equally impressive. The personable rookie seems content to hang in the locker room after skates and entertain questions on a wide range of topics as though he&apos;s truly embracing the moment. 
And did we mention that Murray&apos;s the real deal? His play on the big stage provided a stark contrast to the struggles of former Vezina Trophy winner Henrik Lundqvist . The King is one of the greatest goaltenders of his generation, but watching him finish both Games 4 and 5 on the bench after allowing 10 goals on the final 41 shots he faced wasn&apos;t just shocking. In a way, it was also sobering. Lundqvist is 34. It&apos;s too early to call him a man in decline, but this was a low point for one of the game&apos;s proudest players. --Scott Burnside Patrick Kane came through for Chicago in Game 5, smoking four defenders before swinging around the net to score the game-winning goal in the second overtime.

The best thing I&apos;ve seen so far has been the will of the Chicago Blackhawks leaders and stars, who simply refused to allow a deep, talented St. Louis Blues team knock them out despite multiple tries. That will of a champion manifests itself in a number of ways. It&apos;s Patrick Kane shaking off an otherwise average game to make a dynamite play in double overtime to win Game 5. It&apos;s the Blackhawks picking up teammate Andrew Desjardins -- who missed an empty net opportunity in the first period of a must-win Game 6, only to see the Blues score seconds later -- with a second-period push for the ages to rally for a 6-3 win and even the series. It&apos;s Jonathan Toews , even without scoring a goal, making plays to put his team in position on both sides of the ice. It&apos;s a Marian Hossa backcheck. A marathon effort by Duncan Keith . A blocked shot or 20 from Niklas Hjalmarsson . Faced with a deficit that would have done in most teams, Chicago coach Joel Quenneville put the pressure right on the shoulders of his best players and they responded, setting up a winner-take-all Game 7. -- Craig Custance The post-Game 5 handshake line with the rival Kings was one the San Jose Sharks have dreamed of for 24 months. Andrew D. Bernstein/NHLI/Getty Images No way San Jose would collapse this time 
That&apos;s easy: Game 5, San Jose Sharks at Los Angeles Kings , Staples Center, April 22. The crazy thing was that, despite San Jose being up 3-1 in the series and absolutely outplaying the Kings, the pressure seemed just as heavy on the Sharks entering this game as it was on the team facing elimination. And we all knew why, because a Game 5 loss would reintroduce the narrative of San Jose&apos;s collapse in 2014, when it was up 3-0 on those same Kings. So when the Sharks went up 3-0 in Game 5 this time around, it felt like the series was over. The Kings showed zero signs of life. San Jose was finally going to do this. Then came three consecutive second-period goals by the Kings. Mayhem at Staples Center. And a storyline straight from hell for San Jose. But that&apos;s when something funny happened. A composed Sharks squad came out in the third period, calmly dropped three goals on the Kings and went on to win 6-3. It was sweet redemption. And, as Sharks center Joe Thornton said afterward, a handshake line that felt mighty good. What a game and what a moment. It&apos;s one I&apos;ll never forget. --Pierre LeBrun During the second period of Game 2, Capitals left wing Jason Chimera&apos;s shot from center ice trickled past Philadelphia goaltender Steve Mason -- to devastating effect for the Flyers. Rob Carr/Getty Images Mason&apos;s costly miscue 
A dump-in attempt from 101 feet away that slowly slipped through the legs of Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Steve Mason completely changed the outlook of Philly&apos;s series with the Washington Capitals . 
During a 4-1 loss in Game 2 at Verizon Center in Washington, Mason&apos;s inability to stop that puck proved crucial. The Capitals&apos; Jason Chimera , who stood just beyond the red line, redirected the puck on a backhand and it made its way toward Mason. He tried to stick it to the corner but it trickled in for Washington&apos;s second goal, which proved to be the game winner. Editor&apos;s Picks

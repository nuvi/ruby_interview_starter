FCC&apos;s Wheeler Circulates Charter-TWC Approval Still needs to be voted; Justice Department OKs deal with conditions 4/25/2016 02:50:00 PM Eastern Follow @eggerton 
The FCC Monday circulated its expected approval—with conditions—of the proposed Charter-Time Warner Cable-Bright House merger. That followed the Department of Justice announcement it had allowed the deal to proceed with conditions. 
“Based on imposed conditions that will ensure a competitive video marketplace and increase broadband deployment, an order recommending that the Charter/Time Warner Cable/Bright House Networks transaction be approved has circulated to the Commissioners. As proposed, the order outlines a number of conditions in place for seven years that will directly benefit consumers by bringing and protecting competition to the video marketplace and increasing broadband deployment,&quot; FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said in a statement. &quot;If the conditions are approved by my colleagues, an additional two million customer locations will have access to a high-speed connection. At least one million of those connections will be in competition with another high-speed broadband provider in the market served, bringing innovation and new choices for consumers, and demonstrate the viability of one broadband provider overbuilding another. 
“In conjunction with the Department of Justice, specific FCC conditions will focus on removing unfair barriers to video competition. First, New Charter will not be permitted to charge usage-based prices or impose data caps. Second, New Charter will be prohibited from charging interconnection fees, including to online video providers, which deliver large volumes of internet traffic to broadband customers. Additionally, the Department of Justice’s settlement with Charter both outlaws video programming terms that could harm OVDs and protects OVDs from retaliation– an outcome fully supported by the order I have circulated today. All three seven-year conditions will help consumers by benefitting OVD competition. The cumulative impact of these conditions will be to provide additional protection for new forms of video programming services offered over the Internet. Thus, we continue our close working relationship with the Department of Justice on this review. 
“Importantly, we will require an independent monitor to help ensure compliance with these and other proposed conditions. These strong measures will protect consumers, expand high-speed broadband availability, and increase competition.” 
It has been a month since the 180-day informal shot clock on the deal expired (Monday was day 211), with the FCC said to have been hammering out the conditions under which it will allow the deal. 
The chairman is expected to be able to secure the votes to approve the merger, though he could get some Republican pushback--perhaps in the form of partial dissents or at least in statements--on the breadth of the asks, particularly if it smacks to them of regulating by condition. 
A California administrative law judge earlier this month recommended that that state approve the deal , which would be the last big regulatory hurdle. The California Public Utilities Commission could vote on that recommendation as early as May 12. 
Charter has said the deal will make it the third largest MVPD, serving about 17% of subs nationwide, behind Comcast at 22% and DirecTV at 20%. 
In broadband, it will be the number two wireline Internet provider at 19.4 million subs versus 22 million for Comcast (AT&amp;T is third at 16 million and Verizon fourth at 9.2 million) 
The deal is certainly a way for the FCC to put conditions related to over-the-top video access, broadband buildouts and more in the name of competition and all those broadband and MVPD subs. 
Charter has already promised to abide by the FCC&apos;s Open Internet order no matter what a court does, so the deal was a way to extend that to Time Warner Cable and Bright House as well. It has also promised to extend its policies of no usage-based pricing and settlement-free peering to the New Charter. Want to read more stories like this?

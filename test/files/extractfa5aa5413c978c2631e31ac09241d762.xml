Marcus Trescothick makes his mark on the Somerset record books 25 Apr 2016 17:53 
Veteran opener Marcus Trescothick became the second highest runscorer in Somerset&apos;s history as he led a spirited response by his side against Surrey on the second day of the Specsavers County Championship match at The Kia Oval. 
The 40-year-old lodged the 177th score of over 50 in his 23-year career, making an undefeated 68 as Somerset reached 99 for one in reply to Surrey&apos;s 463 on a day when 45 overs were lost to bad light and rain. 
Trescothick moved above Peter Wight&apos;s aggregate of 16,965 runs for the county when he had scored four and now only Harold Gimblett, who made 21,142 runs between 1935-54, stands above him in the county&apos;s all-time list. 
There were plenty of vintage Trescothick shots to admire between the showers, including a six over backward point when Mark Footitt dropped short. 
At times Footitt struggled to bowl a consistent line but he also troubled both Somerset openers with his raw pace. 
The left-armer, signed from Derbyshire in the winter, struck Trescothick on the chest and his plan to bounce out Tom Abell paid off when Abell, on 22, mistimed a hook and was caught at deep square leg. 
It undid an hour and a half of careful reconnaissance by the 22-year-old,who had demonstrated his undoubted talent earlier in his innings with a couple of superbly-timed clips through his strong areas on the leg side. 
As usual, Trescothick relished any width and a dab down to third man for his ninth boundary took him to his half-century - before rain drove the players off for the third time. 
A restart was scheduled for 5.55pm - but with the players on their way to the middle they turned around as the rain returned. 
After their attack had been mauled on the first day, Somerset fought back during the morning to take the last five Surrey wickets for the addition of 67 runs. 
Tim Groenewald picked up three of them to finish with five for 94, the 13th five-wicket haul of his career. 
His outswinger accounted for Ben Foakes, who was caught behind for eight, and Zafar Ansari - who made 53 on an encouraging return to action following the broken thumb that prevented him joining the England squad for the winter&apos;s series against Pakistan. Ansari batted well within himself but looked in good touch until he edged to second slip. 
Tom Curran and Gareth Batty were both run out looking to accelerate Surrey&apos;s progress and Groenewald finished the innings off when Footitt drove loosely to extra cover. Sport Sites

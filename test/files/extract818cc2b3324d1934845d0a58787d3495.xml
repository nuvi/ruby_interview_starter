Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 9:34 AM By Kent Bush Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 9:34 AM Saturday was a beautiful day for baseball. I miss the dusty sunburns on my skin after a long day at a baseball field coaching my nephew and a dozen of his friends as we took on the world. Having two sons was so exciting to me. I coached my nephews team for a decade. I couldnt wait to repeat the process with my own kids. So of course I took advantage of Saturdays glorious weather and I coached my boys. I didnt get to coach baseball, though. I coached indoor soccer where kids kick an oversized tennis ball back and forth on a basketball court. I had never seen anything like this game a month ago. As fate would have it, my sons dont like baseball. Both of them have played through tee ball and my 12-year-old Blake even hung on through a few years of real baseball before hanging up his glove. I did everything I could to make him love the game. I remember my dad coming home from work and doing the pitching for both teams in a 3-on-3 game in our back yard. Dad taught so many kids in our neighborhood how to hit. We didnt have a left-handed batters box so my left handed friend learned to bat right handed. He still plays golf right handed today. I tried to make it fun for Blake in the yard like my dad did for me. Because Blake didnt love the game on his own, I even gave him money as a reward for good plays. The last couple of seasons, he was a true pro. He was playing for money, not fun  because he wasnt having much fun. He liked being with the guys and he liked competing  well, he liked winning, no one likes losing  but he never loved the game itself. It didnt come naturally to him. Somehow, having another person throwing something hard at him dozens of times during a game just wasnt his idea of a good time. Dawit  my 8-year-old from Ethiopia  was the same way. He did fine at tee ball and even coach-pitch baseball. But it wasnt his idea of fun. Dawit needs more constant action. Hes not a stand and wait for something cool to happen kind of kid. He is a run around like a crazy person until something good happens kind of kid. So I have given up base paths for sidelines as my boys play basketball and soccer  both outdoor and now this new indoor experience. I am disappointed sometimes. It isnt because my kids dont love baseball, it is because I do and coaching them is my only way to be on a field these days. Page 2 of 2 - But an old baseball guy gave some great advice that I am trying to let my kids follow. Do what you love to do and give it your very best. Whether its business or baseball, or the theater, or any field, said Al Lopez, who played and coached Major League Baseball for 20 years. If you dont love what youre doing and you cant give it your best, get out of it. Life is too short. Youll be an old man before you know it. Life is too short to waste time doing something you dont love. Whether you are 8, 12 or 45, you need to find something you love and do it a lot. My kids love soccer and basketball, se we are going to do that a lot. They will be old men before they know it. They might as well have fun before it happens.

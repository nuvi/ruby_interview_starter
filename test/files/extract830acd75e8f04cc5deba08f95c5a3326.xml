February 14-15 Tuesday, Wednesday 
February 17-19 Friday, Saturday, Sunday 
World-renowned singer, songwriter and performer Elton John made a triumphant return to The Colosseum at Caesars Palace with his all new show, &quot;The Million Dollar Piano.&quot; At the centerpiece of the performance is the show&apos;s namesake piano, an engineering marvel featuring more than 68 LED video screens created by Yamaha. 
Elton John&apos;s band features Nigel Olsson on drums, part of Elton&apos;s original three-piece band, as well as musical director Davey Johnstone (who first recorded with Elton in 1971 and joined the band a year later) on guitar, Matt Bissonette on bass, John Mahon on percussion, and Kim Bullard on keyboards, with a special appearance by percussionist Ray Cooper . 
&quot;The Million Dollar Piano&quot; features iconic hits and classic album tracks from throughout Elton&apos;s incredible five-decade career, all enhanced by the most elaborate stage design Elton has ever used. 
Elton is one of the top-selling solo artists of all time, with 38 gold and 27 platinum or multi-platinum albums as well as 58 Billboard Top 40 singles, and he has sold more than 250 million records worldwide. Elton holds the record for the biggest-selling single of all time, &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997,&quot; which sold 33 million copies, as well as for most appearances on Billboard&apos;s Adult Contemporary chart with his 2015 single &quot;Looking Up&quot; marking his 71st entry. He has also written the music for stage and screen successes Billy Elliot : The Musical , Elton John and Tim Rice&apos;s Aida , and The Lion King , which was recently named the highest-grossing stage show or film release in the world. 
Among the many awards and honors bestowed upon him are five Grammys, a Grammy Legend award, a Tony and an Oscar, a Best British Male Artist BRIT Award, induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Kennedy Center Honor, Legend of Live Award, 12 Ivor Novello Awards and a knighthood from HM Queen Elizabeth II for &quot;services to music and charitable services.&quot; 
Showtime is 7:30 p.m. Tickets range in price from $55 to $250 , not including taxes and fees. There is an eight (8) ticket limit per guest. VIP packages are available. Tickets may be purchased by calling 888-9-AXS-TIX, online at www.AXS.com or www.thecolosseum.com and in person at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace Box Office, open daily from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. PT .

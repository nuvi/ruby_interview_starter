Police authorities in Jolo, Sulu recovered the decapitated head of one of the foreign nationals held hostage by the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) on Monday evening (April 25, 2016). 
Police recovered the head of former Canadian mining executive John Ridsdel inside a basketball court along Mayor Sali Yusah Street corner Sari Ahmad Isnani Street at the village of Walled City, Jolo, Sulu, about 7:35 p.m. Monday. 
Jolo Police head Police Supt Junpikar Sitin said the head of Ridsdel, 68, was thrown by two unidentified men riding in tandem on a single motorcycle to a group of men who were about to play basketball in the area. (Photo from Reuters/InterAksyon.com) 
The head of Ridsdel was wrapped in a cellophane plastic bag, Sitin said. 
The two men were on their late 20s and sported long and curly hair and went to an unknown direction under the cover of darkness, witnesses told Sitin. 
Government authorities who rushed to the area to check on the content of the plastic bag were surprised to see the decapitated head of Ridsdel. 
Earlier, a report circulated like wildfire saying that the ASG had beheaded Ridsdel at a forested area in Barangay Lower Sinumaan, Patikul, Sulu. 
The report said Ben Tatoh Sawadjaan was the one who beheaded Ridsdel as agreed by the leaders of the group after his family failed to give in to their ransom demand of P300 million at 3 p.m. Monday, the given ultimatum time of the group to the family of Ridsdel. 
Ridsdel and Robert Hall, 50, Norwegian resort owner Kjartan Sekkingstad, 56, and a Filipina identified as Marites Flor, were seized by the ASG at a luxury marina in Samal Island near Davao City last September 21, 2015. 
The ASG earlier released a video with Ridsdel saying “We’re told that this is the absolute final warning so this is a final urgent appeal to governments, Philippines, Canadian, and families. They will behead me. ” Naldo

The allegations reached a fever-pitch thanks to Sorry, a defiant non-apology to a partner whose misbehavior makes her &quot;regret the night I put that ring on.&quot; Tired of his excuses, and threatening to leave with her child, she ends the song with this bit of casual shade:

So who is Becky?

Beyonc√© fans flooded her comments as a result with bee and lemon emojis, and allegedly changed her Wikipedia page to say, &quot;Next on Beyonc√©&apos;s Hit List.&quot; (Although it has been restored to normal, at the time of publication.)

May want to cool it, Beyhive. &apos;Yonce has this handled.

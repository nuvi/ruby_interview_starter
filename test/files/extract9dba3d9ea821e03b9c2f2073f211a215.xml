£20,000 worth of cannabis plants seized in Cowdenbeath A 47-year-old man has been reported to the Procurator Fiscal. Stock pic: John Devlin. 15:34 Monday 25 April 2016 
A man has been arrested and charged under the Misuse of drugs Act following enforcement activity in Cowdenbeath. 
Officers from the Community Investigation Unit supported local officers to execute a drugs warrant at an address in the Woodbank area on Friday where they recovered a cannabis cultivation from inside the property. 
The value of the recovered plants is around £20,000 and a 47-year-old man will now be reported to the Procurator Fiscal. 
Sergeant Kenny Bow from the Cowdenbeath Community Investigation Unit said: “This successful intervention came as a result of intelligence gathered within the community and once again demonstrates our commitment to acting on any and all information from the public to tackle drug crime and associated offences. 
“During this activity, we have removed a significant amount of cannabis that was intended for distribution on our streets and as a result we have undoubtedly impacted on the local criminals looking to sell these drugs on for profit. 
“I would like to thank the people of Cowdenbeath for their assistance and would ask anyone with information relating to drug crime to contact us on 101 or make an anonymous report to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.” Trending Subscribe to the Fife Today

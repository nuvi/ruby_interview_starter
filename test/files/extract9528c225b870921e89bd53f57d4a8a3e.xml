A Spartanburg, S.C., sheriff is facing backlash for claiming earlier this month that minorities are sometimes “the most racist people in America right now” and comparing the NAACP to the Klu Klux Klan.

Speaking during a Greenville-Spartanburg Republican Women’s meeting April 7, Sheriff Chuck Wright, who is running for re-election, argued that the NAACP is a racist organization because it focuses on advancing rights for only one race, citing an African-American friend of his who feels the same way.
“I’ve got a chaplain who works for me — he’s an African-American, he is my brother and I love him more than anything,” Wright said, according to WYFF-TV . “He doesn’t buy into that mess. A bunch of his friends don’t either. They don’t do the NAACP because I feel like that is a racist group as well as the KKK. I don’t care about them either.”
Wright asserted that he does not want people to associate with a group “that’s got something to do just because of your color” because he doesn’t feel they are “right.”
“I think if we would quit worrying about Democrats or Republicans and just love our neighbors as God told us to, we’re gonna be better. We’re just gonna be better,” he said.
However, his opponent, Russell Lynch, an Independent, finds Wright’s comments “embarrassing” and “not conducive to solving those problems and addressing those issues and building those relationships with anybody, minorities included.”
“It’s an embarrassment to a law enforcement for a law enforcement professional to sum a group like the NAACP up as being a racist organization,” Lynch said. “Because the group I’ve been dealing with in Spartanburg, they’ve been nothing but good people.”
Wright later walked back his comments, saying the NAACP’s Spartanburg chapter “tries to help everybody.”
“There’s a very small group within that group, they’re divisive, and I don’t buy into that mess,” he said. “I certainly wasn’t pointing a finger at anybody. I don’t care about any group or any person who doesn’t respect you just because of whatever color God made you.”

The Democrat party has a long history of deceiving dumb liberal blacks because they refuse to do simple research on the issue. Those in the Democrat Party started the KKK!
Fredrick Douglass, a black man was born into slavery and served as an advisor to FIVE (5) REPUBLICAN U.S. Presidents: (1) Abraham Lincoln; (2) Ulysses S. Grant; (3) Rutherford Hayes; (4) James Garfield; and (5) Benjamin Harrison. Didn\u2019t Democratic President Grover Cleveland removed Frederick Douglas from office but Republican President Benjamin Harrison reappointed him.” In the 19th century, Democrats prevented Black Americans from going to public school. In the 108th Congress, when Republicans proposed a permanent extension of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, it was opposed by the Congressional Black Caucus (composed only of Democrats). African Americans originally came to America unwillingly, having been stolen and sold by MUSLIM slave-catchers in Africa to Dutch traders journeying to America in 1619. In 1866 Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan to pave the way for Democrats to regain control in the elections. George Wallace was a Democrat. Bull Connor was a Democrat. In the 19th century, Democrats prevented Black Americans from going to public school. Jim Crow laws, poll taxes, grandfather clauses, Literacy tests, white only primaries, and physical violence all came from the Democratic Party. http:\/\/frederickdouglassrepublican.com

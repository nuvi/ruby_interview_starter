Is Rachel Roy Beyonce&apos;s &quot;Becky with the Good Hair&quot;? Comment Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 12:01 AM Updated at 12:14 AM Posted Apr 25, 2016 at 12:01 AM Updated at 12:14 AM Fashion designer Rachel Roy -- not to be confused with chef Rachael Ray -- may have outed herself as the already-viral &quot;Becky with the good hair&quot; character from Beyonce &apos;s surprise album, Lemonade .At the end of one of the more angry songs on the album, &quot;Sorry,&quot; Beyonce waves her middle fingers in the air, tells her cheating man &quot;Boy, bye,&quot; and suggests &quot;he better call Becky with the good hair.&quot; It&apos;s throwing premium shade at one of Jay-Z &apos;s alleged side chicks -- and Roy may have volunteered herself as tribute with an Instagram post that alludes to the line. Beyonce&apos;s Lemonade : An emotional rollerocaster in GIFs &quot;Good hair don&apos;t care, but we will take the good lighting for selfies, or self truths, always. Live in the light #nodramaqueens,&quot; Roy tagged the photo, which has now been set to private after Beyonce fans began an online attack. The fashion designer&apos;s Wikipedia page has also been edited to reflect the anger of the Bey Hive.Roy took to Twitter to defend herself, saying that she respects families and finds the bullying she&apos;s experienced unacceptable. I respect love, marriages, families and strength. What shouldn&apos;t be tolerated by anyone, no matter what, is bullying, of any kind.— Rachel Roy (@Rachel_Roy) April 24, 2016 Roy&apos;s Instagram post only fueled rumors that she was the catalyst behind the infamous elevator fight between Solange Knowles and Jay-Z in 2014. Knowles allegedly attacked her brother-in-law because she found his relationship with Roy, the ex-wife of Jay&apos;s former business partner Damon Dash, to be inappropriate. It&apos;s safe to say that whether or not Roy is the real Becky, she won&apos;t be provoking the Bey Hive again any time soon. Other Links From TVGuide.com

RIYADH—Saudi Arabia, crimped by low crude prices, approved Monday a long-term blueprint for the kingdom&apos;s economic transformation aimed at reducing its dependence on oil.
The multiyear plan, dubbed &quot;Saudi Vision 2030,&quot; was approved by the cabinet, according to Saudi Arabia&apos;s monarch, King Salman. The Saudi cabinet, in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency, said the government&apos;s economic council would be in charge of overseeing the vision&apos;s implementation. Saudi officials later Monday were to present a broad overview of the country&apos;s most extensive economic shake-up in decades.
The steep drop in oil prices has given new urgency to Saudi Arabia, the world&apos;s biggest exporter of crude, to find new sources of income. King Salman has entrusted his 30-year-old son, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who heads the economic council, to lead what are likely to be jarring changes in the kingdom.
&quot;By 2020, we&apos;ll be able to live without oil,&quot; the prince told Saudi news channel Al-Arabiya in an interview aired on Monday. He also said less than 5% of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the state-owned oil giant, would be sold off publicly.
The prince said government spending would be restructured more than reduced, and that changes to the government&apos;s generous subsidies wouldn&apos;t affect the bottom 30% on Saudi&apos;s economic ladder.
He also said it would be a while before the plan is fully implemented: &quot;2015 was the year of the quick fix, 2016 is the year of the more organized quick fix, and 2017 will be the year the vision will begin,&quot; he said.
Prince Mohammed also indicated the kingdom&apos;s desire to move beyond its ultraconservative image, saying that Saudi Arabia would &quot;open its doors to tourism of all nationalities in line with its tradition and values.&quot; Currently, Saudi Arabia doesn&apos;t issue tourist visas except to religious pilgrims.
Saudi Arabia isn&apos;t the first country in the region to propose a long-term vision for economic reform. Other Gulf countries—the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait—have presented similar plans in the recent past. But implementation has been a challenge in countries where the absence of elected officials has hampered accountability.
In Saudi Arabia, a country where oil still makes up over 70% of revenues, the shift away from oil could set in motion a fundamental revision of the kingdom&apos;s social contract. For decades, the ruling monarchy lavished its population with generous spending and asked for no taxes in return.
The prolonged period of cheap oil has put a strain on state finances, and Riyadh has already taken some steps to address it. It cut spending, issued domestic bonds and tapped heavily on its foreign exchange reserves, which dropped by around $116 billion, or 16%, to $616.4 billion over the course of 2015. This month Saudi Arabia also turned to international banks for the first time in 25 years, sealing a $10 billion loan.
And at the end of last year, the government took the difficult step of raising the domestic price of fuel, water and electricity. In a country where the population is accustomed to cheap utilities and no taxes, these changes have been hard to swallow.
The sudden rise in water prices—and billing mistakes that resulted in exorbitant charges for some—for instance prompted a widespread backlash. Over the weekend, King Salman fired his minister of water and energy, Abdullah al-Hussayen, and temporarily handed his portfolio to the minister of agriculture.
The economic changes come at a politically sensitive time for Riyadh. The kingdom is engaged in a costly war in neighboring Yemen, where it suspects Iran is funding and supplying weapons to the Houthi rebels. Iran has denied arming the Houthis. More broadly, the kingdom is stepping up efforts to assert contain the influence of Iran.

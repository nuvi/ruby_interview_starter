An evening of shimmer and shine at Killarney Country Club Posted April 25, 2016 by Heather Hook 
The 30 th of March saw Killarney Country Club (KCC) host an illustrious re-launch of the Club’s biggest venue, the Crystal Room (previously known as the Gold Room). Although the Crystal Room has always been home to weddings, birthday parties and bar mitzvahs as well as corporate functions, over the past 2 years the Club’s General Committee had debated its refurbishment. The General Committee is constantly looking at ways of enhancing the Club and its offerings and with this; the need for KCC to be current and relevant to the Club’s members and guests is a key consideration during all the Committee’s discussions. And so it was decided that the grand venue would undergo some minor surgery and upliftment. 
The refurbishment of the Crystal Room began on 11 January and was completed without any delays by the corporate interior designers, DG², on 31 January. The process included retiling, installing new carpets and skirting, repainting, recladding the rooms columns, taking out unnecessary columns in the entrance to open up the space and upgrading the bathroom tap to name but a few of the processes involved. “I am very grateful to our design and project team of Liezel and Heinz for the room we have today. The next phase of upgrading the Crystal Room will include alterations to the stage and addition of conferencing facilities so that we can ensure the Crystal Room is fully up to date with industry standards. “ said Gary Levy, Killarney Country Club President. 
Plans were then set in motion to invite the Club’s members, valued corporate clients, media and event planners for an evening of shimmer and shine. The evening began with guests walking a black carpet as an electric violinist greeted them on arrival. A scrumptious food and bowl dinner, prepared by Killarney’s new head chef, Sihle Skwambane, was immediately enjoyed by guests upon entering the Crystal Room. While guests relished in the food, a surprise opera act was performed by Elegant Entertainment delighting guests as the realisation dawned upon them that some of the staff for the evening were not just any ordinary staff members. 
Gary Levy then opened the evening saying as part of his speech “On behalf of management I would like to thank the following sponsors who helped make tonight possible, Protea Wines, Simonsig Sparkling wines, Heineken, Norman Goodfellows, ABI, Bunches Flowers, Hausbrandt Coffee, Kristel Birkholtz and Elegant entertainment. I trust you enjoyed the food, drink and entertainment here tonight. A big thank you to our dedicated and hardworking management team of Tiaan, Theresa, Raurie, Martin, Sue and Karen, without you tonight wouldn’t have been possible. And to you our members and guests, have fun and enjoy our time together. Thank you for making Killarney that special home.” 
The night’s entertainment was in full swing after the President’s speech and continued with Parker’s Comedy and Jive as Kidibone Mulaudzi, Mum-z and Mark Banks left guests in absolute tears and stitches from all the laughter. As the successful evening came to a conclusion, the soulful jazzy sounds of the band Jazzmatix could be heard over the chatter of all who attended and the electric atmosphere will most certainly be remembered by all.

Sports club snowball still up for grabs Don’t forget the Woodlands fair which will be taking place on Sunday, 5 June. 6 hours ago 
WOODLANDS Sports Club’s snowball was not won on Friday, 22 April as A Holtzhuisen was not present. 
The meat draw was won by Andy and Sandra, second and third prize was won by Kobus. 
The club swindle was won by Andy and Sandra, Molly and Maggie, Yvonne, Cobus and Carole won two prizes. 
A good weekend was had by all, especially with the Sharks’ narrow win on Friday. 
Don’t forget the Woodlands fair which will be taking place on Sunday, 5 June. Come join in, there will be entertainment for the children. Food and refreshments will be available and moms can get in some shopping. 
Should you be interested in booking a table, these are available at R20 each. For more details, call Carole on 031-469-1092. SHARE

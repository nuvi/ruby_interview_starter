QPR defender now more confident than ever thanks to extended run in side 14:30 25 April 2016 Grant Hall (left), pictured putting in a challenge on Reading&apos;s Simon Cox in Saturday&apos;s 1-1 draw against the Royals, has been excellent for QPR this season EMPICS Sport 
Grant Hall says he is now a far more confident player than he once was, hailing QPR’s impact in that transformation. 
  
The defender has been a rare shining light in what has been a disappointing season for the Rs. 
The 24-year-old, who has previously played for the likes of Blackpool and Birmingham, has benefitted hugely from a regular starting berth in his first season in blue and white hoops. 
He told the Times: “I’ve been really happy with how this season has gone on a personal level. 
“I’ve certainly exceeded my expectations this season. I came in as a back-up player and took my opportunity with both hands and just gone from strength to strength. 
“The managers who have been here this season have shown a lot of faith in me. I owe Chris Ramsey a lot for bringing me to the club, and of course now Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. 
“I’m a young defender and having the chance to be a big part in this team has just breeded confidence in me. 
“Obviously there’s been times where I’ve made mistakes in games, but that’s only natural, you just need to make sure you learn from that. 
“It’s a very tough league, so I’m only going to learn the hard way. Before I wasn’t as confident as I am now, so I owe this club a lot for their role in that.” 
The former non-league starlet also hailed the role his regular centre-back partner and skipper Nedum Onuoha has had on him. 
He added: “We complement each other’s games well. We’ve played a lot together this season and have build up a good understanding. 
“We haven’t played with each other as much recently as he’s been at right-back, so it was nice to be back playing with him on Saturday [against Reading], as I think we have a really good partnership. 
“He’s been great with me ever since I’ve been at the club. He’s club captain and very experience and he’s helped me a lot. I’m only learning from him week in and week out. 
“Playing next to him regularly can only benefit me in the long term.” 
He continued: “The physical side of my game has improved a lot. This league is very demanding and I’ve learnt a lot this season. 
“From playing more regularly I’ve definitely added more consistency to my game, too. 
“My ultimate aim is to play in the Premier League, and hopefully I can do that with QPR. 
“That’s a target for me and for the club, as well, so hopefully we can push on in the future. 
“I’ve had set backs in my career before, but that makes you hungrier to succeed. 
“We’re getting to where we want to be now, we’re improving all the time and hopefully we can take that into next season and build on that and push for the play-offs.”

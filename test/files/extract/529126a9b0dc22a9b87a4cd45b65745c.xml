Our Apps Kingman to pay for Route 66 promotional trip to Germany 
KINGMAN, Ariz. (AP) - The city of Kingman will fund one resident&apos;s trip to Germany so he can promote international Route 66 tourism. 
The Kingman Daily Miner reports ( http://bit.ly/1VUafEv ) that the City Council on Tuesday voted to provide nearly $4,900 to Jim Hinckley to help him attend the inaugural European Route 66 Festival near Stuttgart, in southern Germany. 
Hinckley, a historian, will be in Germany in July to present a slide show about the Arizona portion of the historic highway. He also has meetings scheduled with several tour companies to discuss lodging, attractions and other features and amenities of northwestern Arizona. 
Route 66 is very popular in Europe and is gaining attention internationally. A festival in the Czech Republic in 2014 attracted 20,000 people.

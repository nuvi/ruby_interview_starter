With the 11th pick in Thursday&apos;s first round of the NFL draft , the Bears are in an advantageous position.
It&apos;s a range that recently has proven fertile with impact players. Sure, general manager Ryan Pace would feel better if he was picking third where he would have the first selection not named Jared Goff or Carson Wentz .
But consider that since 2010 the following players have come off the board between the 11th and 15th picks: Odell Beckman Jr., Aaron Donald, Sheldon Richardson , Star Lotulelei , Fletcher Cox , Michael Floyd , J.J. Watt , Robert Quinn , Earl Thomas and Jason Pierre-Paul . That&apos;s two really good wide receivers and eight excellent defensive players.
The 11th pick also offers a real economic advantage. If a team hits on a first-round pick outside of the top 10, the fifth-year option provides a nice break when it comes to the salary for that option year and a negotiating lever for talks on a long-term contract. The fifth-year option is the average of the top 10 salaries at the player&apos;s position in his fourth season for a player drafted in the top 10 – the same amount as the transition tag. For players selected between the 11th and 32nd picks, the fifth-year option salary is the average of the players ranked third to 25th at their position.
That can create a sizable difference favoring the club. The Bears have picked up the fifth-year option for offensive lineman Kyle Long , the 20th overall pick in 2013, which will cost $8.8 million in 2017. The Chiefs are waiting until after the draft to make a decision on offensive tackle Eric Fisher , the No. 1 pick from 2013. The price tag for Fisher will be $11.9 million in 2017, a difference of more than $3 million. That not only impacts the salary cap for 2017, it&apos;s a negotiating edge for clubs like the Bears when it comes to a multi-year extension.
In other words, unless Pace is dead set on a player in the top 10 and the compensation to trade up is a real deal, it&apos;s unlikely the Bears will be motivated to leave their spot. The No. 11 pick could be coveted by other teams and Pace, with nine total picks, seems driven to add more.
The Bears rolled through 13 defensive linemen last season and need to shore up the front for the defense to reach the level they desire. They signed Akiem Hicks , a projected starter at end, and have nose tackle Eddie Goldman, last year&apos;s second-round pick, to build around. But they&apos;re lacking another starting end with Mitch Unrein , Will Sutton and Ego Ferguson more role players. At No. 11, they could get the second defensive lineman in the draft if Oregon&apos;s DeForest Buckner is plucked in the first 10 picks.
An edge rusher such as Georgia&apos;s Leonard Floyd or Clemson&apos;s Shaq Lawson could be appealing but if the Bears are looking to fill a pressing need, they could look at the defensive line. It&apos;s fortuitous that one of their greatest needs matches up with the greatest strength in the draft — defensive linemen.
Brad Biggs&apos; NFL mock draft, version 2.0 Brad Biggs Two huge trades have happened since Mock Draft 1.0 as the Rams and Eagles have moved into the top two spots.

(Brad Biggs) It wouldn&apos;t be surprising if Pace followed the plan former general manager Jerry Angelo used with success in 2004 when the Bears doubled down on tackles with their top two picks, choosing Tommie Harris 14th overall and following him with Tank Johnson in Round 2. Pace could go D-line at No. 11 and repeat the process Friday with the 41st overall pick.
The Panthers did the same thing in 2013 when they got Lotulelei in Round 1 and followed up with fellow tackle Kawann Short in Round 2. Some criticized GM Dave Gettleman but the tackles paired with middle linebacker Luke Kuechly were the backbone of the NFC &apos;s best defense last season. Gettleman explained the Panthers remained true to their board and Short was the best player available.
Alabama&apos;s A&apos;Shawn Robinson and Jarran Reid, Mississippi State&apos;s Chris Jones, Louisiana Tech&apos;s Vernon Butler, Florida&apos;s Jonathan Bullard, Texas&apos; Hassan Ridgeway and Illinois&apos; Jihad Ward could all be options in the first two rounds. Robinson is an ideal five-technique and at age 20 is a mountain of a man.
Using the top two picks on linemen wouldn&apos;t be sexy, but Pace was a defensive end at Eastern Illinois in his playing days and he know improving the front is going to make the linebackers and secondary better. It also would not provide a huge boost to the pass rush but the draft is weak when it comes to edge rushers and the Bears could seek a player with traits in the middle to later rounds, the kind of move that paid off in 2006 with Mark Anderson , who was a fifth-round find.
There are plenty of directions for the Bears to consider but defense is the pressing need and at No. 11, they&apos;re in a good spot for a number of reasons.

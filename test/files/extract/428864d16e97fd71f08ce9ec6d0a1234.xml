Screenshots of black people being hilarious on social media, it doesn&apos;t need to just be twitter but obviously that is best. 
Black culture has a unique way of examining the everyday and we are here to showcase that. You know this shit is funny so don&apos;t be a cunt and accuse people here of being racists. The people whose posts are featured here are the comedians, not the jokes. 
RULES 
Do not post content just because a black person posted it . This sub is intended for exceptionally hilarious social media posts made by black people, not just any social media post made by black people. 
No bullying or witch-hunting. This includes comments disparaging people whose tweets and posts are featured here. Doxxing or sharing personal information will result in a permanent ban. 
No racism . No hate speech. No black fathers posts and similar mean-spirited things. 
Posts must be showcasing somebody being hilarious on social media . Pictures only. No image macros, text conversations, or YouTube links. Just because somebody posted one of these on social media does not exempt it from this rule. Vines and such belong here and gifs belong here . 
Typical reddit cliches such as lyric chains, pun chains, white-knighting, and low-effort joke comments will be removed. 
Reposts are highly discouraged, and if discovered will be removed . Please search or look through BPT&apos;s older posts to see if your content has already been posted. KarmaDecay is not a reliable tool to check for reposts. 
No posts with terrible titles, they will be removed. You are free to re-submit once you get creative. Don&apos;t put the punchline in the title of the post . Do not add &quot;bruh&quot; or &quot;fam&quot; or similar vernacular to your post or comment just to sound black. 
Don&apos;t complain about slang or ask for the definition of a term you don&apos;t understand if it can readily be found on urban dictionary . 
Posts about politics or political figures are not allowed. This is not a place to shill for or against your favorite candidate. 
Don&apos;t call out people as white. People of all colors do post and comment here. It contributes nothing to the conversation and is punishable by ban. 
The moderators of this subreddit will take any action (which includes banning and removing comments) that they feel improves the quality of the subreddit.

Home \ Music &amp; Entertainment \ #LUKATAR Acoustic Version #LUKATAR Acoustic Version 05 Mar 
This is the acoustic version of my brand new single #LUKATAR. I did a competition not so long ago for my #Shurrporters and the winners were invited down to ‘Spend An Evening With Leshurr’ and see an exclusive private performance of the acoustic version! I decided to experiment with this song combining melodies and strings and some powerful vocals from the very talented guitarist Zak! You can now purchase the original version of #LUKATAR on iTunes, Spotify &amp; Amazon NOW for just 79p! https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/lukatar/id961650184?i=961650793 Thankyou for listening

11th annual Newburyport Literary Festival set for April 29-30 Comment By By Darrell Halen / newburyport@wickedlocal.com North of Boston By By Darrell Halen / newburyport@wickedlocal.com Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 11:37 AM Updated at 11:38 AM By By Darrell Halen / newburyport@wickedlocal.com Posted Apr 25, 2016 at 11:37 AM Updated at 11:38 AM NEWBURYPORT Vicki Hendrickson hopes people attending this year’s Newburyport Literary Festival take away two things from the event: a book bag filled with autographed books and memories of enjoying a day when all they thought about was the magic of books. Hendrickson is one of the founders of the festival, which will be held Friday, April 29 and Saturday, April 30. This year is the 11th year of the festival and will be the largest with more than 80 authors. The writers come from a wide variety of backgrounds, including poets, children’s book writers, historians and people who’ve produced fiction or non-fiction work. The event kicks off with an Opening Night Overture featuring former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell discussing his book, “The Negotiator.” Mitchell, a native of Maine, is a former Senate majority leader, a special envoy to Northern Ireland, a special envoy to Middle East Peace, and an investigator of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. Mitchell’s talk, which is sold out, will be followed by Opening Night Ceremony: The Loves and Love Poems of Edna St. Vincent Millay. Described as America’s foremost love poet, Millay grew up in Newburyport and Ring’s Island. This year’s festival honors poetry and the late Millay is one of two poets being honored. The other is Debbie Szabo, a longtime English teacher at Newburyport High School. “I’m very flattered and honored to be honored,” Szabo said. “It’s a good feeling to be appreciated.” Szabo, an award-winning educator, who will be honored Saturday night at the festival’s closing ceremony, is credited with developing an appreciation for poetry in many of her students. According to the festival website, she teamed up with local poets and students to launch “Poetry Soup,” a forum for student poets. Szabo also created the Newburyport version of the Favorite Poem Project, a public celebration of poetry, and she coaches the high school’s poetry slam team for “Louder than a Bomb,” which is held in Boston and is the largest youth poetry slam in the country. “I’ve done a lot to keep poetry alive in the community,” Szabo said. Saturday’s activities will begin with an informal breakfast and conversation with local poets who live in and around the city. That will be followed by talks by authors and various panel discussions, including conversations about William Shakespeare, crime and horror writing, genres, LGBTQ literature for teens, young adult literature, and more. Some of the writers slated to speak include Andre Dubus III who will read from a selection of his recent essays, Daniel Korschun, the co-author of “We are Market Basket: The Story of the Unlikely Grassroots Movement that Saved a Beloved Business,” and security expert Anthony Amore who wrote the book “The Art of the Con.” Page 2 of 2 - Other writers include Naoko Stoop, a writer and illustrator of children’s books who will read from her works and teach kids how to make origami paper hats, author John Brady who wrote a dual biography of Frank Sinatra and Eva Gardner, and bestselling author Tess Gerritsen who will discuss her latest novel, “Playing with Fire.” Dane Morrison, a professor of early American history at Salem State University, is the author of “True Yankees: The South Seas and the Discovery of American Identity.” According to the festival website, Morrison will describe how the South Seas voyages of commerce and discovery by Americans introduced their new nation to the world and introduced Turks, Chinese and others to a “new people.” “I’m very excited,” said Morrison, a first time speaker at the festival. “It’s a chance to present my book to an engaged audience. I think it’s going to be a lot of fun. I’m excited to share the discoveries of my research.” Hendrickson says the popular festival appeals to readers and people who enjoy meeting their favorite or new authors and poets. For parents and children, local history buffs, and lovers of fiction, poetry and nature, she said, there isn’t a better place to be. The festival, which draws around 5,000 attendees, will also feature seventh-grade students from Rupert Nock Middle School who will share their local history projects.

Organizers are also looking for Saturday afternoon volunteers.

Police are looking for man who knocked down and robbed an 89-year-old woman in the parking lot of an Abbotsford, B.C. credit union. 
The robbery took place on Thursday April 14, just after the woman and her daughter made a withdrawal at the credit union in the 32700 block of South Fraser Way. 
Once the pair left around 2 p.m. PT, the suspect followed them out and grabbed the older woman&apos;s black purse as she got into the passenger side of their car. 
At least one person tried to chase down the suspect, who fled northbound, but he managed to get away, said Constable Ian MacDonald. 
The suspect is described as: White male in his 20s. Thin build. Wearing a Bench hoodie. 
The woman was knocked to the ground during the robbery, and was later taken to hospital for treatment of scrapes and bruises. She&apos;s now recovering at home with the support of her family, said MacDonald. 
Police believe the suspect may have entered the credit union with plans to rob the cashier, but changed his plan after overhearing the woman&apos;s transaction. 
Police did not say how much cash was stolen. 
Anyone with information is asked to call the Abbotsford Police Department at 604-859-5225, or call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.

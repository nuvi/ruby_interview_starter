Another great casual option is the ubiquitous polo shirt. 
It’s another piece that looks classier than a t-shirt, but is just as easy to wear. 
Polo Ralph Lauren makes the iconic version, but pretty much everyone makes one nowadays – even Uniqlo . 
Polo Ralph Lauren Polo Shirt ($85) A pair of casual chinos. 
For that gray area of formality, chinos are perfect. Wear them with a polo for a casual look, or a button-up and blazer to dress it up. 
These slim-fit garment-dyed Brooks Brothers chinos are a good choice, but we recommend putting the effort into finding a pair that’ll fit your particular body and budget. 
Brooks Brothers Milano Fit Garment-Dyed Chinos ($98) A pair of dark denim jeans. 
You don’t have to be a denimhead to appreciate the clean aesthetic of a dark denim. Dressed up or down, they’re always clean, and a well-made pair will have your back in all casual environments for years to come. 
Originally you could only get a pair from reproduction companies in Japan, but in recent years American companies, like the pictured Rogue Territory, have sprouted up in response to increased demand stateside. 
Then again, there’s nothing wrong with the standard Levi’s. 
Rogue Territory SK 11 oz ($220) A high-quality t-shirt that fits perfectly. 
This one is non-negotiable. Even if you don’t see yourself as a type of guy that wears a t-shirt casually, some situations just call for being comfortable. 
White is the most versatile color there is, but this is no undershirt. 
This is another case of finding one that works for your body type. Ones to try include the pictured Uniqlo , American Apparel , and even Target’s Mossimo brand . 
Uniqlo Supima Cotton Short Sleeve T-shirt ($10) A pair of boots for after-work drinks. 
Every man needs a pair of super-versatile shoes that look neither dressed up nor casual. They fill that nebulous space between dress shoes and sneakers. 
Many guys’ go-to is Clarks’ ever-popular Desert Boot , but there are plenty of more expensive options. 
Clarks Desert Boots ($130) A pair of weekend casual sneakers. 
Sneakers are more acceptable in more places than ever before. Wear them all weekend, and give your dress shoes a rest. 
There are a ton of great options from New Balance , Nike , and Adidas.

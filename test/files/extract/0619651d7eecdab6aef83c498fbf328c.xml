Read more about sharing. Justin Carney scored 63 tries in 62 games for Castleford before moving to Salford Salford Red Devils have confirmed the signing of on-loan Castleford winger Justin Carney on a three-year deal from next season. 
The 27-year-old Australian is on a season-long loan with the Red Devils, having missed the end of last season after being suspended by the Tigers. 
The former Sydney Roosters and Canberra Raiders player has scored six tries in 12 outings so far this season. 
&quot;I feel right at home at Salford,&quot; Carney told the club website. 
&quot;[Owner] Marwan Koukash was there from day dot for me and there are a lot of people like Michael Dobson, Weller Hauraki and Junior Sa&apos;u I have played with previously and I work well with.&quot; 
Head coach Ian Watson added: &quot;Justin is a real good bloke to have around the place. 
&quot;He is a 100-miles-per-hour player and he is the top metre-maker in the competition this year. That&apos;s a big plus for any team.&quot; Share this page

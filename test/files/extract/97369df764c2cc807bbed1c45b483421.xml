Blackhawks-Blues: Is there such thing as a Game 7 edge? Blackhawks-Blues: Is there such thing as a Game 7 edge? By Tracey Myers April 24, 2016 8:15 PM 
ST. LOUIS – The Blackhawks have played a few of these Game 7s in the past. 
In every case over the past five years they forced the Game 7, winning late in a series to erase a deficit. They’ve had momentum entering each one. And on Sunday, prior to departing for St. Louis, the Blackhawks liked where they were entering this Game 7, too. 
“Well, I think we wanted to get ourselves in this spot,” coach Joel Quenneville said. “We put ourselves in an awful spot a little while ago. [Now] we put ourselves exactly where we want to be. We’ve got momentum; we’ve got to be excited about this challenge.” 
There’s never a doubt about the excitement level. Hockey Game 7s just bring that out of every team, whether it’s the one that had the series lead or not. But does the team entering with momentum have the Game 7 edge, especially if that team has several players who have been through this before? Or with the series squared and with both squads facing elimination, is there such thing as having an edge? 
“I think it helps to be there and have that experience,” said Marian Hossa, who’s played in six Game 7s since the 2008-09 season. “But again [it’s] starting 0-0, so it could go either way. Maybe in certain times you can use that experience.” 
The Blackhawks certainly have been here before, playing in four previous Game 7s under Quenneville. They lost in overtime in Vancouver in the 2011 Western Conference quarterfinals, beat the Detroit Red Wings in overtime in the 2013 conference semifinals, fell to Los Angeles in overtime of the 2014 conference final and beat Anaheim in last year’s conference final. 
So it’s been mixed results. Outside of last year’s game against the Ducks, in which the Blackhawks built a big lead early, every game has been tightly contested. The Blackhawks expect the same close game tomorrow against the Blues. 
The Blackhawks came back from a 3-1 hole in this series to force Game 7. They have enough guys on this team who know winning Game 7s means playing the right way, keeping calm in anxious situations and getting something from everyone. 
Having one other element doesn’t hurt, either. 
“I think you have to have mental toughness,” Duncan Keith said. “I mean, I don’t think we really analyze things too much or try to measure certain things. But we’re just out there playing and we know that when we’re down 3-1 we’re in a situation where we’ve got nothing to lose. We were down 3-1 and we found a way to do it in Game 5, and then last night I thought we played a good game and had a lot of composure being down 3-1 in the game at one point. So it’s just kind of sticking with it.” 
The Blackhawks clawed their way back into this first-round series. The Blues have been a formidable opponent, and they’ll be hungry to dispatch their division foe on their home ice. Can the Blackhawks eke out one more? They’ve been here, done this before, and they’re looking to do it again. 
“We put ourselves in a tremendous spot. Have fun with it, play the way we did the last couple of games,” Quenneville said. “We keep getting better, and that’s what we’re looking for.” Blackhawks finding balance on all four lines Blackhawks finding balance on all four lines By Charlie Roumeliotis April 24, 2016 3:00 PM 
When Joel Quenneville decided to reunite Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews on the top line, you knew it wasn&apos;t an ideal situation. 
The Blackhawks only utilize that &quot;nuclear option&quot; during desperate times, and trailing the St. Louis Blues 3-1 in their first-round series qualified as one. 
But pairing them together has often worked out in their favor, as it did towards the end of the 2015 Western Conference Final against the Anaheim Ducks and Stanley Cup Final against the Tampa Bay Lightning. 
It&apos;s again reaping benefits for all four lines, which is a large reason why the Blackhawks have climbed back to even up the series 3-3. 
&quot;When we went to those lines, I thought we had balance,&quot; Quenneville told reporters Sunday. &quot;I think that was what we were looking for. Putting Kaner and Tazer (together), we always find that&apos;s when we&apos;re in a real bad spot or tough spot. We tried that and we felt that we had more balance. With the way the lines turned out in the game, we liked the way we played.&quot; 
Those in-game adjustments by Quenneville is what makes him of the best coaches in NHL history, and the Blackhawks continue to roll with and trust the changes without questioning them. 
Marian Hossa and Andrew Ladd, both of whom are normally on the first line with Toews, were bumped to the third line with Marcus Kruger, but both of them have been around chess-master Quenneville long enough to know it&apos;s a tactic, not necessarily a demotion. 
&quot;Not at all,&quot; Hossa said. &quot;I mean, you know we keep rolling four lines and quite honest, two nights ago, being on the third line I played more ice time than when I was on the first line. ... I&apos;m glad to help the team, especially at my age, any way I can. I have defensive responsibilities, but Joel wants us to create something offensively too. So it&apos;s pretty much the same. My job didn&apos;t change.&quot; 
While the double-overtime victory in Game 5 surely played a big part in those increased minutes, Hossa&apos;s right in a sense he&apos;s getting more ice time, as the new third line of Ladd, Kruger and Hossa finds itself out more against the line of Jaden Schwartz, Jori Lehtera and Vladimir Tarasenko, which has had its way against the Blackhawks this series. 
That also opens up the first and second lines to produce more offensively, and it showed in Game 6. 
Kane, Toews and Andrew Shaw combined for one goal and three assists, while Richard Panik, who also saw time on the top line, registered a helper. 
The Blackhawks are starting to come in waves, and the ability to change on the fly and gel quicky is what has helped the reigning Stanley Cup champions have so much success in the playoffs under Quenneville. 
And it will be key to a Game 7 victory in St. Louis on Monday night. 
&quot;As you go along in a series, I think you start seeing your own teams, who&apos;s playing well, who&apos;s deserving of most ice time, who&apos;s playing in situations where they deserve more quality and quantity,&quot; Quenneville said. &quot;That&apos;s part of how we make the alterations. In games we&apos;re looking for balance, we still think we need four lines to win. 
&quot;As we&apos;ve gone along here, probably all year long, that&apos;s one area we didn&apos;t feel it was nailed. I like the progress we&apos;re seeing in the series right now. Probably the best we&apos;ve had all year long so that&apos;s a positive sign right now. That&apos;s what we&apos;re looking for.&quot;

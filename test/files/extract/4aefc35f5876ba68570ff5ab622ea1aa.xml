Duluth Receives Pathways To Prosperity Grant Monday, April 25, 2016 10:05 a.m. CDT by Dave Strandberg Mn DEED logo 
DULUTH, MN (KDAL) - The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) has awarded Duluth a grant of nearly 73 thousand dollars for the &quot;Pathways to Prosperity&quot; program. 
The program helps low-wage and low-skill adults that have multiple barriers to employment to prepare them for jobs in growing fields in Duluth such as health care. 
The City of Duluth Workforce Development Division, in partnership with Essentia Health, St. Luke&apos;s and Lake Superior College, has developed a 150 hour certificate program for entry level health services occupations. 
To get more information about that program and other services of the Duluth Workforce Center, visit their webpage at duluthmn.gov/workforce-development/ or call 218-302-8400.

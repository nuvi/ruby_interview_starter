 18 AM EDT Drill Bits Market 2016-2020 Industry exmined by Syndicate Market Research 
Drill bits machine are cutting tools used to remove material to create holes, always of circular cross-section. Drill bit is a tool designed to create a cylindrical hole in the earth’s crust by the rotary drilling machine method for the extraction of hydrocarbon such as natural gas, petroleum, and crude oil. Drill bits are mainly classified into two types such as rolling cutter and fixed cutter bits. The structure of rolling cutter drill bits are tooth shape. Rolling cutter is used to two or more cone shaped element that roll across the borehole as the bite is rotated. Fixed cutter mostly use in natural or synthetic diamond, to remove material by grinding action as the bit is rotated. 
Increasing world energy demand with high cost of natural oil and gas is the major driving factors for the global drill bits market for oil and gas application. Large scale drilling and Exploration and Production (E&amp;P) activities in both onshore and offshore oilfields, is the another key driving factor for drill bit. Moreover, Advancement in technology to provide better services expected to fuel the drill bit market over the forecast period. However, government control over oil and gas price hamper adoption of new technologies.

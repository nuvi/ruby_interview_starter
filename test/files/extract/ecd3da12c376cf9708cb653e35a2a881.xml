Bill Kristol, son of Irving, names Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Mitt Romney, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and others on his hypothetical shortlist of third-party candidates that he could run if Donald Trump becomes the Republican nominee. The Weekly Standard editor and self-styled neoconservative power broker is back to talking about a third party, declaring that a Trump victory in Indiana would force him to re-focus on his so-called Latter-Day Republicans independent ticket. A third party could help to split the vote on the Right and elect Hillary Clinton president, which would allow Kristol to stave off the Trump threat and regain control of the party in 2020 without actually having to formally support Clinton. (Excerpt) Read more at breitbart.com ... KEYWORDS: 3rdparty ; gopliars ; gopsaboteurs ; krystal ; nevertrustromney ; nevertrustthegop ; romney Here&apos;s the deal. Free Republic exists for you, and because of you. Without the generosity of people like you, Free Republic would wither and die. Then where would you go to find a group of like-minded people, standing for the values and principles of conservatism, spreading the word about those who would tear down our way of life, and just plain having fun? 
Free Republic doesn&apos;t have the financing of some billionaire, hidden in the background. Free Republic is &quot;grass roots&quot; all the way. We&apos;re not looking for 10 donors with $10,000 each, but we sure could use 10,000 donors with $10 each. The dollar amount may be the same, but the difference is in how we get there. 
WE NEED YOU! Anything you can give is so greatly appreciated. If you can become a monthly donor, that is fabulous. If five dollars is what you can manage, bring it! Your on-going support is crucial, and our thanks to you are immeasurable. 
God bless,

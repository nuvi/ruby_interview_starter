« HPR Black Ops Freedom Vehicle Is Up For Auction On GunBroker.com MDFI – Training Passport 
Midwest Defensive Force Institute has developed a Training Passport to keep track of attendance at their entire course catalog. 
The spiral bound logbook features hard plastic covers that will protect the waterproof pages. That’s right, the pages are printed on Rite-in-the-Rain paper. You can write on it but it won’t turn to mush if it gets wet. 
As you can see, the pages are well laid out and include plenty of room for notes. 
They’ve even included blank pages for attendance at courses presented by other instructors.

  25, 2016 @ 10:40 Fatherhood , Health and Safety 1 comment With great interest I read this CBC article about the fact many Canadians diagnosed with asthma don&apos;t in fact have it. This was my experience with my firstborn. 
Weeks before his second birthday, my oldest ended up in the hospital with pneumonia. I spent five nights sleeping on that cot while we watched old VHS tapes of Sponge Bob Squarepants. During this stay, an asthma specialist at St. Joseph&apos;s Health Center diagnosed my son with asthma and prescribed two inhalers. One of these inhalers was to be taken by my son every morning, so we started him getting used to this new ritual. 
Coincidentally, and sadly, his pediatrician at this time died suddenly from an aggressive form of cancer. We switched him to a new pediatrician and I&apos;ll never forget the convo I had with him, only a few months after James&apos;s asthma diagnosis. 
Doc: He only had pneumonia the once? Me: Yes Doc: And there&apos;s no other difficulty breathing? Me: Correct Doc: And the doctor diagnosed him with asthma and prescribed this puffer to be taken daily? me: Yes Doc: He doesn&apos;t have asthma (proceeds to throw inhaler in garbage). He doesn&apos;t need this treatment. 
This was about 12 years ago, and there hasn&apos;t been a symptom of asthma since. The doc who made the original diagnosis was well regarded in his field but time has proven him wrong. I&apos;m not at all surprised to read about studies like this Dutch one . More than 600 children diagnosed as having asthma were examined and it was found nearly 54 per cent likely did not have it. 
I am not a doctor, but if your child has been diagnosed with asthma, you may want to get a second opinion. And then, if it&apos;s all tied up, a third opinion. Inhalers have negative side-effects. You don&apos;t want your kid taking one every day if they don&apos;t have to. Share this entry

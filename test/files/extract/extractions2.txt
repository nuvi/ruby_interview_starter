Beyonce fans swinging at alleged other woman in new song &apos;Sorry.&apos; Compiled by Tony Hicks, thicks@bayareanewsgroup.com Posted: 04/25/2016 11:35:25 AM PDT Updated: 04/25/2016 11:37:37 AM PDT Beyonce&apos;s fans are losing their minds over who might be the &quot;other woman&quot; in her new song &quot;Sorry.&quot; 
The song, released last weekend, has fans swinging at celebrity chef Rachael Ray, instead of fashion designer Rachel Roy, the alleged target of the song. 
The very subtle (not really) line says &quot;He better call Becky with the good hair.&quot; 
Fans immediately went after Ray on social media, according to The New York Daily News, calling her a &quot;homewrecker&quot; and generally making fun of her homemaking skills. 
Celebrity stylist and designer, Rachael Zoe, was also targeted for allegedly messing with Beyonce&apos;s man Jay Z. 
Beyonce surprised the world of pop music, releasing her new album &quot;Lemonade&quot; on Saturday. In this Oct. 20, 2015 photo, Beyonce arrives at TIDAL X: 1020 Amplified by HTC in New York. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File) 
There&apos;s some history between Roy, the ex-wife of Jay Z&apos;s former business partner Damon Dash, and Beyonce. She was allegedly the reason Beyonce&apos;s sister Solange went after her brother-in-law in an elevator after the Met Ball in 2014. 
Roy reportedly tweeted on Sunday &quot;I respect love, marriages, families and strength. What shouldn&apos;t be tolerated by anyone, no matter what, is bullying, of any kind.&quot;

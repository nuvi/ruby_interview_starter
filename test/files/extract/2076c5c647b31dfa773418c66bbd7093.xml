Biker Dad: Mom shamed on Facebook for daughter&apos;s motorcycle ride - Live5News.com | Charleston, SC | News, Weather, Sports Member Center: Biker Dad: Mom shamed on Facebook for daughter&apos;s motorcycle ride, fires back 2016-04-24T16:58:25Z Source: Facebook Corpus Christi, TX (WMC) - 
A biker mom is defending herself after a social media shaming. A driver posted a photo of her daughter to a social media group. It shows the 7-year-old on the back of a motorcycle. Along with her pink tennis shoes and pink backpack, she&apos;s wearing a full-face helmet and clinging to the man operating the sport style bike. The picture sparked outrage that the little girl was too young to be riding on a motorcycle and that the adult rider was putting her in danger. 
But Mallory Torres, that little girl&apos;s mom, fired back on her own Facebook page in a status post that has been shared as of this writing nearly 20,000 times. Although many of the comments are still critical of the Corpus Christi, Texas mother and her boyfriend, John Hays II, the vast majority are throwing their support behind them. 
I interviewed them LIVE on Facebook via Skype Sunday afternoon. You can watch that interview here Biker Dad 
Torres&apos; status update starts off with a bold statement, &quot;Some of you may have seen this picture on Facebook, and some of you may have even seen this in person...This is my 7 year old daughter riding home from school on a motorcycle. Yes. She&apos;s 7, and she&apos;s on a motorcycle. &apos;Why?&apos; Some of you may ask... Because I love my daughter. That&apos;s right... I LOVE MY DAUGHTER and she loves to ride, so I allow her to ride on the back of a motorcycle in full gear with my boyfriend who has 20+ years of experience.&quot; 
When I shared the post on the Biker Dad Facebook page , readers reacted immediately, commenting passionately on both sides of the argument. 
Michael Donnelly commented &quot;Should be against the law. I have to wear a seat belt inside a car with airbags and here: no seat belt. It&apos;s a crime. These people should go to jail or at least pay the state a large fine so they can learn their lesson.&quot; But again, the vast majority of the comments have been in support like Stephenie Jonathan who commented, &quot;by the time my kids were old enough to talk they started learning motorcycle safety. I was born and raised a biker and my children will be as well. It&apos;s my job to prepare them for life, not hide them from it.&quot; 
Torres, according to her Facebook page is the owner of &quot;Sugar Sugar&quot; a cake company in Corpus Christi. She goes on in her post, compelled now to not only defend the ride but her parenting skills in general. &quot;We&apos;ve been called &apos;bad parents&apos; for allowing her to ride. Bad parents??? Hahahaha. NO. Our children are fed, they are happy, they are healthy, they are up to date on all of their shots and healthcare visits, they are punished when they misbehave and they are praised when they do good. They are EARLY every day to school, they do well in school, we are both stay at home parents that run a home based business together which means that WE raise or children. Not sitters or daycare.&quot; 
I researched the law in the state of Texas. Whether or not you think it&apos;s a bright idea to have a 7-year-old on the back of the motorcycle, it doesn&apos;t appear to be illegal. This is what I found on the Texas DMV&apos;s website. It reads in part: &quot;A passenger must be at least five years old. If the passenger is under 21 years old they must wear a helmet. If the passenger is 21 years old or older they may be exempt from wearing a helmet if they meet the exemption requirements . For more information on passengers, visit: Texas Transportation Code and read Chapter 545 Section 416.&quot; 
Here in Tennessee, the law isn&apos;t based on age. According to the state motorcycle manual: &quot;Effective July 1, 2012, it is a Class C misdemeanor to carry a child as a passenger on a motorcycle whose feet are not on footpegs. This law does not apply to persons riding in a motorcycle sidecar.(2012 Public Chapter 907).&quot; 
Meanwhile Torres ends her viral status update, &quot;I WILL continue to keep my kids happy and pray that they are safe whether it be at school, at home, at a friend&apos;s house, on the basketball court, or on a motorcycle. I&apos;ll tell you what i WON&apos;T do though. I won&apos;t keep my child from riding just because a handful of close minded, ignorant people think they are the definition of a &quot;perfect parent&quot;.THERE IS NO POINT IN BEING ALIVE IF YOU AREN&apos;T LIVING!!! ?&quot;

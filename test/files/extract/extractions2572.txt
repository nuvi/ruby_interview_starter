Defending champions Juventus mathematically secured a record-equalling fifth consecutive Serie A title on Sunday after Roma stunned second-placed Napoli with a last-gasp winner.
Juventus, emulating their feat of 1935 when the Turin giants won a fifth straight title for the first time, had gone 12 points clear of Napoli with a 2-1 win at Fiorentina on Saturday when goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon made a last-gasp penalty save from Nikola Kalinic.
Napoli had to beat Roma to have any chance of maintaining their bid for a first title in 26 years, but Maurizio Sarri&apos;s men were stunned when Radja Nainggolan hit an 89th minute winner for the hosts.
It left Juve 12 points clear of Napoli with only three games remaining this season. Napoli remain second but are now just two points ahead of Roma.

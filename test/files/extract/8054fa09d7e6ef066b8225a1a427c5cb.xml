In many ways, Google engineer Benson Leung has become the voice for the USB Type-C standard, famously reviewing cables that are sold on Amazon and checking to make sure that they&apos;re up to standard . Back in November, he called out Qualcomm&apos;s Quick Charge 2.0 and 3.0 as not being up to snuff. 
This raises issues for devices such as the LG G5 and the HTC 10, which both use USB Type-C and Quick Charge 3.0. Note that Google&apos;s own Nexus devices use &apos;fast charging&apos;, and not Qualcomm&apos;s own tech. 
According to Leung, Quick Charging &quot;takes over the D+/D- (usb data) lines for good, so that Type-A port can&apos;t be used to communicate to your PC at the same time you fast charge.&quot; While USB Type-C can deliver the kind of voltage that Quick Charge requires, that&apos;s not the way that Qualcomm implements it. 
Qualcomm has responded, stating that using Quick Charge is completely safe. In an interview with SlashGear , the firm said the following: 
Let’s distinguish between compliance and compatibility. Quick Charge and USB Type-C are compatible. There are many smartphones on the market today utilizing both USB Type-C and Quick Charge 3.0/2.0. These devices are compatible with both technologies. Certified Quick Charge adapters are designed to communicate with a given device and deliver the requested voltage. In fact, Quick Charge intelligence helps ensure the proper charge is delivered regardless of connector type and cable length or thickness. 
In other words, while Quick Charge doesn&apos;t fit the USB Type-C specification, it&apos;s not something that you need to worry about as a user.

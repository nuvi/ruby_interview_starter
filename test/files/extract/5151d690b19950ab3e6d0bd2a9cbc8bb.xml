Brady &apos;Deflategate&apos; suspension upheld: Will it affect game vs. Seahawks? KING 5 News and Associated Press , KING 9:42 AM. PDT April 25, 2016 New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady (Credit: Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST 
NEW YORK - A federal appeals court has ruled that New England Patriots Tom Brady must serve a four-game &quot;Deflategate&quot; suspension imposed by the NFL, overturning a lower judge and siding with the league in a battle with the players union. 
Whether that suspension will come when the Seahawks visit the Patriots on Nov. 13 remains to be seen pending further appeals. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday in New York. The decision by a three-judge panel may end the legal debate over the scandal that led to months of football fans arguing over air pressure and the reputation of one of the league&apos;s top teams. It is also likely to fuel a fresh round of debate over what role, if any, the quarterback and top NFL star played in using underinflated footballs at the AFC championship game in January 2015. The appeals ruling follows a September decision by Manhattan Judge Richard Berman that went against the league, letting Brady skip the suspension. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell insisted the suspension was deserved. 
ESPN reports the NFL Players Association and Brady can petition for a re-hearing or appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. They would have to request a stay of the suspension during the appeal process. 
If an appeal is upheld or no stay is granted before the start of the season, Brady would likely miss the first for games of the year against the Arizona Cardinals, Miami Dolphins, Houston Texans, and Buffalo Bills. But if the appeal is delayed and a ruling to uphold the suspension comes down later, then the four-game ban could come midseason – perhaps even during the game against the Seahawks.

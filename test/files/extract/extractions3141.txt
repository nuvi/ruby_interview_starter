Huawei Honor v8 leaks, could be a premium phone from a budget brand 04/25/2016   
Huawei’s Honor brand of smartphones are typically low-to-mid range devices with specs that sometimes punch above their weight class. The Honor 5X , for instance, is a $200 phone with a full HD display, a 3,000 mAh battery, a fingerprint sensor, and a Snapdragon 616 octa-core CPU. 
But it looks like the upcoming Honor V8 may be a straight-up flagship phone. It’s got the specs of one anyway. We won’t know the price until Huawei officially launches the phone on May 10th though. 
Here’s what we do know: the honor V8 showed up at China’s TENAA website recently, complete with pictures of the front, back, and sides of the phone and a description some of the most important specs: 5.7 inch, 2560 x 1440 pixel display 2.3 GHz octa-core or 2.5 GHz octa-core processor options 4GB RAM 64GB storage + microSD card slot 3,400 mAh battery Dual rear cameras with laser autofocus and dual-tone flash Android 6.0

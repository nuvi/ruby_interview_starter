  Tim Peake achieves Guinness World Records title for the Fastest marathon in space 
ESA Astronaut Tim Peake has achieved a brand new Guinness World Records title for the Fastest marathon in orbit, running the Digital Virgin Money London Marathon 400km above earth on-board the International Space Station in 3:35.21. 
He has completed his first marathon from space, running along with those tackling the London Marathon back on Earth. 
Tim completed 26.2 miles strapped into a harness attached to a treadmill aboard the International Space Station (ISS) 
He used the RunSocial app to see the first-person view of the course as well as live coverage of the race in London. 
In 1999, he completed the same race on the ground in 3:18:50. i-e Tim took few additional minutes for completing the race in space. Running from space poses its own unique challenges because of the lack of gravity. 
Tim Peake is not the first astronaut to complete a marathon in space. In 2007, Nasa’s Sunita Williams ran along with the Boston Marathon runners, completing it in 4 hours and 24 minutes.

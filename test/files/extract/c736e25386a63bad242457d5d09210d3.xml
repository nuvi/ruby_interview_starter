Work on Worcester&apos;s new Aldi is progressing well say company bosses IMPRESSION: An aritist&apos;s impression of the new Aldi at the retail park in St John&apos;s, Worcester. 0 comments 
WORK on a new discount supermarket in Worcester is nearing its final stage ahead of the grand opening this summer. 
Aldi is set to open this summer at the retail park in Tybridge Street, St John&apos;s, Worcester, in place of the former PC World unit, creating 40 jobs. 
PC World decided to relocate to alternative premises elsewhere in Worcester. 
An Aldi spokesperson said: “We received excellent support from the local community for our plans and are delighted to be getting closer to opening the store this summer. 
&quot;Approximately 40 new jobs will be created, in addition to the multi-million-pound investment into the area. 
“Many people said that they had trouble travelling across Worcester to visit our existing store, so we are very happy to be able to provide residents in the west of Worcester with convenient access to an Aldi food store.” 
The existing car park will be used for the new store, with parking remaining free for up to two hours while people complete their shopping.

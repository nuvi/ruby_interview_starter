Traffic switches to new SR 520 floating bridge Monday John Langeler reports. CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST 
SEATTLE, Wash. -- When traffic is reopened across Lake Washington on the new SR 520 bridge Monday morning, it will mark the end of a four-year process to modernize and enhance the toll crossing. 
While it represents the completion of $4.56 million of work, it does not mean construction on the highway is finished. 
Funding to reconstruct the west side of the crossing through Montlake to I-5 was approved by the legislature. At just over $2 billion, unfinished work includes HOV lanes, bike and pedestrian crossings and other enhancements including a pair of &quot;lids&quot;, which are parks laid over the highway. 
&quot;The changes are positive,&quot; commented Judy Ogliore, who lives above the highway in Montlake, &quot;I think that when it&apos;s finished it will be really beautiful.&quot; 
&quot;But we&apos;re ready for it to be done,&quot; she concluded. 
The West Approach Bridge connecting the new floating bridge to Seattle is expected to finish in 2017. Other aspects of the I-5 to Lake Washington project, including the park lids, will not be under construction until 2018, according to WSDOT plans.

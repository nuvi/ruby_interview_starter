Witness accounts of Prince&apos;s state of health in his final days continued to come to record Sunday, as local store clerks reported finding themselves in agreement that he appeared to look weak to them, while his brother-in-law shared that the late musician hadn&apos;t slept for the 6 1/2 days leading up to his untimely death. “Everyone I’ve talked to on that Saturday said he looked kind of pale and he was not totally looking in the best shape as he normally is,&quot; said Max Timander of the Electric Fetus record shop. The employees, like most fans at the time, were under the impression that he was just getting over the flu. 
In hindsight the news that his airplane had to make an emergency stop on the way back from a show on April 14th might have seemed peculiar, but it wasn&apos;t until the unresponsive body of 57-year-old Prince Rogers Nelson was discovered and declared deceased in his Chanhassen, Minnesota mansion a week later, that reports of an alleged overdose on opiates being responsible for the sudden landing, began to surface. It is now known that Prince disregarded the recommendation of doctors at the Illinois hospital that received him, that he remain resting under 24 hour hospital supervision. He was seen at a dance party the following evening and at a Jazz club several days later. Following a private cremation, family returned to Paisley Park to join a memorial, where his brother-in-law Maurice Phillips revealed to mourners that despite his condition, their hometown star had worked for 154 straight hours. 
Investigators are now looking into whether he had been over-prescribed drugs, as such a case of insomnia conflicts with the effects of the percocet he is believed to have O.D.&apos;d on April 14th. Detectives have reportedly discovered numerous prescription pills and thus far have no knowledge as to whether they were authorized by a physician. Some friends have been leaning on the investigation to consider whether there may be a &quot;dodgy doctor&quot;, involved; as had turned out to be the case in Michael Jackson&apos;s mysterious death. Meanwhile, a man claiming to have at one time been Prince&apos;s &quot;drug dealer&quot; revealed himself Saturday to alleged that Prince had been paying him $40,000 every six months between 1984 and 2008, for supplies of Dilaudid pills and Fentanyl patches; both highly addictive pain killers.

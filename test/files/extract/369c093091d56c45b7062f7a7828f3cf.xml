Danniella Westbrook hits back at critics over 24-year-old fiancé 
Danniella Westbrook | © PA Images Posted on Monday 25 April 2016 
Danniella Westbrook has hit back at critics over her younger fiancé, 24-year-old George Arnold. 
It’s as the 42-year-old revealed she’s trying for a baby with him and hopes to be married by the end of the year. 
Speaking to Good Morning Britain , she said that she’s hit back at online trolls who criticised her for the age gap. 
&quot;He might be 24 but he is 44 in his mind. The press can be harder on women for dating someone younger than they are on men. But I&apos;m too busy at home with George to worry about that sort of thing. Happy happy happy Sunday xx off to lunch with my George .. New home .. New start .. New day .. So so happy pic.twitter.com/dNNlHBA1r0 — Danniella Westbrook (@westbrookdanni) April 3, 2016 
&quot;Last night, this woman on Instagram was laying into me saying &apos;I&apos;d never go with a man my son&apos;s age&apos;. I was like, &apos;That&apos;s okay darling because nobody is asking you to!&apos;&quot; 
It’s unclear how long she’s been seeing her new man, but she’s ‘smitten’. After a 12hr day on set crying in every scene but 2, I&apos;m now driving 190 miles 2 c a certain someone for 24hrs #Smitten #SouthLondonBeau — Danniella Westbrook (@westbrookdanni) December 16, 2015 
Danniella has been married twice before and has two children from separate relationships, 19-year-old Kai and Jody, who’s 14. 
The star will return briefly to Eastenders as Sam Mitchell, for the funeral of her on-screen mum Peggy Mitchell who is played by Barbara Windsor.

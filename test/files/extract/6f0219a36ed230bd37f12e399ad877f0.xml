Schumer backing Obama’s $1.9 billion emergency funding plan to battle Zika virus By PUBLISHED: MONDAY, APRIL 25, 2016 AT 1:20 PM PREV A A 
U.S. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., is putting his support behind U.S. President Barack Obama’s $1.9 billion funding plan to battle the Zika virus before mosquito season kicks in. 
President Obama has been pushing for the emergency funding to combat the virus, which is spread through mosquitos, since early this year. Along with more common symptoms, including fever, joint pain and conjunctivitis, the Centers for Disease Control has said the virus causes birth defects if pregnant women are infected. 
Of the 800 recorded cases across the country, 60 have been in New York state. 
Sen. Schumer said the funding needs to be approved before mosquito season starts, potentially expediting the spread. 
“Simply put, anyone repellent to this emergency funding plan isn’t serious about beating Zika,” Sen. Schumer said. “When it comes to fighting this epidemic, a stitch in time will save nine and so, I will do everything in my power to make sure emergency funding is delivered.” 
The emergency funding would be used to help develop a vaccine, expand mosquito control programs and provide better access to contraceptives. 
Sen. Schumer has previously made other efforts this year to draw attention to the virus. He has called on a handful of organizations, including the U.S. Agency for International Development, National Institute of Health and CDC support vaccine development efforts. He also advocated for the World Health Organization to declare the Zika outbreak an international health concern. WHO officially made the declaration Feb. 1. 
Back in February, the House of Representatives rejected Obama’s funding proposal and urged that funding once dedicated to fighting Ebola be repurposed for Zika. Over $500 million in anti-Ebola funding was then transferred to battling Zika in early April, according to the New York Times. 
President Obama also signed a law last week that would push more pharmaceutical companies to help develop a vaccine.

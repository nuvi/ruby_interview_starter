Sports Extra 2016 Houston Texans NFL Draft Guide Could the Texans add a new playmaker at wide receiver or help on the D-line for J.J. Watt? The Associated Press, USA Today Sports &amp; KHOU.com Share This Story

HOUSTON — The Houston Texans got a much-needed upgrade at quarterback in free agency. 
Now they need to find a new target in this year&apos;s draft to catch Brock Osweiler&apos;s passes. 
The Texans addressed their biggest need during free agency by luring Osweiler away from the Denver Broncos with a huge $72 million contract to take over at quarterback for Brian Hoyer, who was released recently. 
The Texans return star receiver DeAndre Hopkins, who made his first Pro Bowl last season after finishing third in the NFL with 1,521 yards receiving. But they could use the 22nd overall pick to find a receiver to play opposite Hopkins and take some pressure off the 23-year-old who faced near constant double teams last season. 
Top receivers who could still be around when Houston&apos;s spot comes up are Will Fuller of Notre Dame and Baylor&apos;s Corey Coleman. 
Though receiver is clearly Houston&apos;s biggest need, there&apos;s certainly no guarantee the Texans will use their first pick on the position. 
The Texans have a strong history with taking receivers in the first round. 
Hopkins was the 27th pick in the 2013 draft and has started every game in his three-year career. He came to Houston 10 years after the Texans took Andre Johnson with the third overall pick in 2003. Johnson was a seven-time Pro Bowler who spent 12 years with the Texans and is the team&apos;s all-time leading receiver with 13,597 yards.

The consensus seems to be that the Texans will select a wide receiver if they stay at the No. 22 spot. However, the question is whether they will go for a deep threat or a polished route-runner with good hands.

The Other Texans Defensive End 
The Texans have J.J. Watt returning to lead their defense. But who&apos;ll be the team&apos;s other defensive end is far less clear. 
Jared Crick, who started 31 games opposite Watt in past two seasons, signed with Denver. 
They&apos;ll likely need to add a DE in the draft with Jeoffrey Pagan and Dan Pettinato as the only other defensive ends on the roster. Pagan appeared in six games last season and had just one tackle, and Pettinato did not appear in a game as a rookie.

Brown&apos;s Progress 
Left tackle Duane Brown, Houston&apos;s starter since 2008, tore a quad muscle in the regular-season finale and likely won&apos;t be ready for the start of training camp. 
But he should be ready for the season opener. Even if he is, it couldn&apos;t hurt for Houston to add depth on the offensive line to help protect the new $72 million quarterback. 
Defense First? 
Houston&apos;s biggest need is on offense, but it wouldn&apos;t be a surprise if the Texans went with defense instead. 
The Texans have selected a defensive player with their first-round pick in 10 of 14 drafts. 
Their first-ever draft pick was quarterback David Carr, but they drafted defensive players the other two times they had the top overall spot, adding end Mario Williams in 2006 and outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney in 2014. 
They also took a defender with their first pick last year, Wake Forest cornerback Kevin Johnson.

Here&apos;s USA Today Sports look at the top wide receivers (and one tight end) available: 
1. Laquon Treadwell, Ole Miss 
As his 40-yard dash time (4.63 seconds at his pro day) proved, Treadwell is not a burner. But he doesn’t have to be. He’s excellent at using his large frame to overpower and leverage cornerbacks into giving up plays. He has reliable hands, and if there’s any concern about his speed, just watch how he made plays against some of the top defenses in the SEC, such as his five-catch, 80-yard, one-touchdown performance against Alabama last September.

2. Corey Coleman, Baylor 
The NFL squad that picks Coleman is going to have to understand that his route tree will be limited and that he lacks the ideal size (5-foot-11, 194 pounds) to play at the next level. But Coleman is an intriguing prospect because of his explosion off the line of scrimmage and his ability to produce in the deep passing game. That production is due in part to the offense the Bears run, but it’s hard to argue with the numbers: Coleman led the nation with 20 receiving scores. 
3. Josh Doctson, TCU 
With 36.5% of TCU’s targets in 2015, Doctson is used to be a team’s No. 1 receiver. In the pros, he might be better served as a second target in an NFL offense. One of his best strengths is an ability to win on 50-50 passes, thanks to strong hands and a 41-inch vertical leap. His next quarterback should love that about him. One thing Doctson could improve on is his physique. He’s got the size at 6-foot-2, but at 202 pounds, he&apos;ll have his timing and routes disrupted by physical cornerbacks. 
4. (TE) Hunter Henry, Arkansas 
Thanks to a solid overall skill set, Henry should be an instant contributor from Week 1. He’s productive both in the passing game and as a blocker. He has enough speed to be a mismatch against most linebackers, and he’s too big (6-foot-5, 250 pounds) for safeties to handle him. But perhaps his best asset is his hands. He’s as consistent as it gets with tight ends, not registering one drop this season. He made numerous plays in traffic on the way to a 51-catch, 739-yard, three-touchdown season in 2015. TOP DEFENSIVE ENDS 
Here&apos;s USA Today Sports look at the top five defensive ends available: 
1. Joey Bosa, Ohio State 
A three-year starter with the Buckeyes, Bosa is the most pro-ready defensive end after leaving the Buckeyes with 51 tackles for loss and 26 sacks for his career. Equipped with an excellent blend of size, power and quickness, Bosa appears to be one of the safer picks in the entire draft. Though his production dipped a bit in 2015 – going from 13.5 sacks the previous year to five – Bosa constantly saw double teams and improved as a run defender. He comes from a pedigree of first-round defensive ends, and should be an instant contributor on defense, no matter which team takes him.

2. DeForest Buckner, Oregon 
At 6-7, 291 pounds, Buckner has the massive frame fit for a 3-4 defensive end in the NFL. More than just a big body, he proved to be a constant disruptive force at Oregon and overpowered his opposition for 10.5 sacks last season. Buckner&apos;s build has earned him comparisons to former teammate Arik Armstead, who was selected No. 17 overall last year by the San Francisco 49ers. But Buckner&apos;s athleticism and motor should put him in position to be a top 10 pick. 
3. Shaq Lawson, Clemson 
The only questions about Lawson entering the NFL scouting combine focused on his athleticism. An ultra-productive career at Clemson showed that Lawson could make plays on the field. But a 40-yard dash time of 4.7 seconds (fourth-best among DEs) and a broad jump of 120 inches (tied for fifth-best among the position) put all those concerns to bed. Lawson played at multiple spots along Clemson’s defense, which should appeal to both 3-4 and 4-3 squads. He’s thick, powerful and sheds blockers with excellent use of his hands. 
4. Noah Spence, Eastern Kentucky 
He may be the most athletic defensive end in the entire draft, but there are serious questions about Spence after he copped up to two failed drug tests while at Ohio State, both for ecstasy. He spent time in rehab, was permanently banned from the Big Ten and transferred to Eastern Kentucky. With the Colonels, Spence recorded 22.5 tackles for loss and 13.5 sacks. His broad jump at the NFL scouting combine of 121 inches tied for third best among all DEs. He has all the physical tools franchises want in an edge rusher, but can he be trusted off the field? 
5. Kevin Dodd, Clemson 
Dodd may very well end up being the top defensive lineman of this class, but with only one year as a starter for the Tigers, it may be some time before he can become a consistent NFL pass rusher off the edge. The good news for Dodd is that once he entered the starting lineup – opposite Lawson – he put up monster numbers. But he was saving the best for last. In the National Championship Game against Alabama, Dodd tallied five tackles for loss and three sacks. The performance sent his draft stock soaring. A hamstring injury suffered in the 40-yard dash, however, is worth monitoring. TEXANS RIVALS 
Draft capsules for AFC South teams: 
5. JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS (5-11) 
LAST SEASON: Finished with losing record for seventh time in past eight years, and latest one dropped coach Gus Bradley&apos;s record to 12-36 in three seasons. Jaguars offered glimmer of hope that better days are ahead by showing some offensive prowess for first time since 2007. QB Blake Bortles and dynamic WRs Allen Hurns and Allen Robinson emerged as solid core of playmakers. But defense was team&apos;s downfall, prompting Bradley to fire coordinator Bob Babich after season. 
THEY NEED: LB, DE, S, CB, OL. 
THEY DON&apos;T NEED: QB, WR, RB, TE, DT. 
POSSIBLE FIRST PICK: CB/S Jalen Ramsey, Florida State; LB Myles Jack, UCLA; DE Joey Bosa, Ohio State; DE DeForest Buckner, Oregon. 
OUTLOOK: General manager Dave Caldwell has made it priority to upgrade defense. He signed DT Malik Jackson, S Tashaun Gipson and CB Prince Amukamara in free agency, adding to last year&apos;s class that included DE Jared Odrick, CB Davon House and LB Dan Skuta, but still needs more talent, depth and competition on that side of ball. It wouldn&apos;t be shocking to see Jags use six or more of their eight draft picks on defenders. 
15. TENNESSEE TITANS (3-13) 
LAST SEASON: Not even Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota could save Ken Whisenhunt&apos;s job, and he was fired after 1-6 start by owner determined to see better protection for rookie quarterback. Mike Mularkey made enough changes to earn job in January, even if he didn&apos;t win many more games. Winning just five times combined over past two years cost general manager Ruston Webster his job, too. 
THEY NEED: OT, WR, CB, DL, S, LB. 
THEY DON&apos;T NEED: QB, RB. 
POSSIBLE FIRST PICK: OT Ronnie Stanley, Notre Dame; OT Jack Conklin, Michigan State; WR Josh Doctson, TCU; CB Vernon Hargreaves, Florida. 
OUTLOOK: New GM Jon Robinson made one of biggest trades in NFL history two weeks before draft, swapping No. 1 overall pick to Rams and picking up three more picks in this draft. Robinson now has nine selections, including six in first 76 picks. He says he now can be as flexible; he wants to move back up from No. 15 or move around draft to keep rebuilding roster. Protecting last year&apos;s No. 2 pick overall, Mariota, by drafting another offensive tackle would help; QB missed four games to injury as rookie. Mariota needs more people to throw to, and defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau always can use more players. 
18. INDIANAPOLIS COLTS (8-8) 
LAST SEASON: Colts discovered what life without Andrew Luck is like — no playoffs. Luck regressed in Year 4, throwing 15 TD passes and 12 interceptions while missing nine games with injuries. Backup Matt Hasselbeck provided initial spark but retired in February. Indy&apos;s biggest problem was offensive line that allowed way too many hits. Defensively, Colts never found consistent pass rush and struggled to stop run. Result: .500 record in season Indy was projected to be Super Bowl contender. 
THEY NEED: OL, DL, LB, CB. 
THEY DON&apos;T NEED: WR, QB. 
POSSIBLE FIRST PICK: OT Taylor Decker, Ohio State; OT Jack Conklin, Michigan State; LB Leonard Floyd, Georgia; DE Shaq Lawson, Clemson; C Ryan Kelly, Alabama. 
OUTLOOK: GM Ryan Grigson provided offseason blueprint in February — fixing offensive line and pass rush. But salary-cap constraints didn&apos;t allow Colts to do much in free agency, so Grigson must find help in draft. Indy has significant needs on offensive line, especially guard and center, which could prompt Grigson to trade down and still find help. If Grigson stands pat, he could take right tackle or look for pass-rushing defensive lineman or linebacker. Another option would be finding cornerback to start opposite Pro Bowler Vontae Davis. DRAFT SLEEPERS 
By Arman Markazi, USA Today Sports 
Here is a breakdown of some of the top sleepers available for the 2016 NFL draft: 
QB Kevin Hogan, Stanford 
Many overlook him because of underwhelming numbers and a limited arm, but Hogan is a proven leader and winner. Succeeding Andrew Luck as a redshirt freshman with the Cardinal, Hogan stepped in and showed great maturity. He always seems to put his team in the best position to win and has a fairly high floor as an above-average backup. His ceiling is as a Kirk Cousins-type game-manager who can make timely plays with his arm and underestimated running ability (4.76 40-yard dash). Hogan might be the smartest and most-experienced quarterback in this class. Teammates at Stanford raved about the two-time team captain’s ability to command the huddle. He could go somewhere on Day 3 and immediately improve a team’s QB room.

RB Daniel Lasco, California 
He didn’t draw much attention until the East-West Shrine Game. Lasco was a team MVP and all-Pac-12 honorable mention as a junior, racking up almost 1,500 total yards and 14 touchdowns. He couldn’t stay healthy as a senior because of nagging hip and ankle injuries. Lasco had a stellar performance at the Shrine game, rushing for 62 yards. And at the combine he was a top performer in four of seven drills. Lasco has opened a lot of eyes and has a lot of scouts going back to the tape. He should be a valuable chess piece for a coach looking for a third-down back who can be a positive asset on special teams. 
WR Jordan Payton, UCLA 
In a deep class of wide receivers, Payton is outside most people’s top 15 to 20 at his position. Whether it’s his possession-receiver stigma or his perceived lack of athleticism, people don’t seem to love this player. He impressed during his week in Mobile, Ala., at the Senior Bowl with his consistent practice performances and had a noteworthy combine, running a 4.47 40 to erase doubts about his speed. He left UCLA as its all-time leader in receptions (201). A quarterback-friendly route-runner who has the ability to play slot and outside receiver at the next level, he could be picked somewhere on Day 3. 
OT Spencer Drango, Baylor 
It’s not often that a two-time all-America and all-conference player can be consider a “sleeper,” but Drango’s case is a bit different. Most evaluators don’t think he has the feet or athleticism to stay at his natural offensive tackle position and want to move him to guard. Drango does have the size and strength to be a nice power right tackle with the ability to kick in and play guard. At the Senior Bowl, he impressed people with his run-blocking skills and ability to hold his own against some of the best pass rushers in the country. A four-year starter, Drango has the experience and technique to play at the next level. 
OG/C Jack Allen, Michigan State 
An undersized center, Allen has to make up for his lack of stature with competitiveness, tenacity and proper technique. A strong run blocker with improving pass protection skills, Allen is an ideal fit in a zone running scheme where coaches will appreciate his leadership and smarts. A high school wrestling champ in Illinois, Allen has toughness and aggression in the middle and can anchor. He had a tough week at the Senior Bowl handling some of the bigger linemen, but on tape it is evident that this player, put in the right scheme, can be a positive asset to an offensive line group. He won’t hear his name until Day 3 of the draft, but whoever takes him will be glad they did. 
DE Yannick Ngakoue, Maryland 
Ngakoue improved every season and finished his junior year with a Maryland-record 131/2 sacks. The first-team all-Big Ten selection wreaked havoc on opposing offensive tackles with his athleticism off the edge and relentlessness to get after the ball. He lacks the ideal length as an edge player but makes up for it with a slippery ability to always be around the ball. He could go in the third or fourth round. 
DT Chris Jones, Mississippi State 
In one of the deeper defensive tackle classes in recent history, a player such as Jones might get lost in the shuffle. He could have done himself a service by going to school for another season, but he started every game and regained the form he showed as a freshman. He’s a solid defensive line prospect who can stop the run and pressure the quarterback from the pocket. He has quickness off the snap, strength at the point of attack and the ability to disrupt gap running schemes. Versatile Jones can be a valuable asset to a defensive line group. 
OLB Kyler Fackrell, Utah State 
The well-balanced defender can contribute in different roles, with his hand in the dirt or standing up. He has the length and motor to come off the edge and get after the quarterback and also has the athleticism and agility to drop into pass coverage and hold his own against a tight end or running back. Having gone through a torn anterior cruciate ligament as a junior, Fackrell returned to form as a senior and made multiple positive plays a game. At the Senior Bowl, he impressed decision-makers with his versatility. This flexibility combined with his potential as a pass rusher makes him an exciting prospect for all 32 clubs. 
ILB Tyler Matakevich, Temple 
The 2015 Nagurski and Bednarik Award winner, Matakevich was an ultra-productive linebacker at Temple. Not the biggest, strongest or fastest, he is a film junkie and student of the game who shows the desire to be great. He makes up for his lack of size and athleticism with great technique, instincts and preparation. The four-year starter accumulated more than 100 tackles every year and was a three-time first-team all-American Athletic Conference selection. His leadership and consistency helped turned a perennial loser into a conference contender. His physical traits might cap his potential, but the kid will give you everything he has. He might start off on special teams, but he has the potential to move into a bigger role. 
CB Tavon Young, Temple 
A small corner at 5-9, Young will be taken off certain draft boards right off the bat because of his stature. What he lacks in size he makes up in effort, athleticism and heart. A high school track star, Young translated his speed to the football field, shutting down opposing top receivers in the AAC. Starting games for the Owls since his true freshman year, Young was a huge asset for a program that took huge leaps from relative obscurity to double-digit victories. He was invited to the Senior Bowl and stood out in practices as a battle-hardened corner who had confidence going against players from the bigger programs. He showed the ability to play bigger, break up passes and make plays on the ball with ultra competitiveness. In the right system, he could be an asset in the slot and on special teams. 
S Miles Killebrew, Southern Utah 
Even though he’s from a small school, Killebrew is gaining traction as a big, long safety who plays violently and looks to punish pass-catchers. Still raw in coverage, he makes up for it with his toughness, tackling and physicality. A four-year starter, Killebrew was productive from the beginning and improved every season. At the Senior Bowl, he grabbed attention with his willingness to mix it up with talents from bigger conferences. He might have a future in the league similar to Mark Barron and Deone Bucannon as a hybrid linebacker who can match up with tight ends and running backs. Until he reaches his potential at safety, he could be a nice special-teams player. Share This Story

Sports Extra 2016 Houston Texans NFL Draft Guide Could the Texans add a new playmaker at wide receiver or help on the D-line for J.J. Watt? The Associated Press, USA Today Sports &amp; KHOU.com Share This Story

HOUSTON — The Houston Texans got a much-needed upgrade at quarterback in free agency. 
Now they need to find a new target in this year&apos;s draft to catch Brock Osweiler&apos;s passes. 
The Texans addressed their biggest need during free agency by luring Osweiler away from the Denver Broncos with a huge $72 million contract to take over at quarterback for Brian Hoyer, who was released recently. 
The Texans return star receiver DeAndre Hopkins, who made his first Pro Bowl last season after finishing third in the NFL with 1,521 yards receiving. But they could use the 22nd overall pick to find a receiver to play opposite Hopkins and take some pressure off the 23-year-old who faced near constant double teams last season. 
Top receivers who could still be around when Houston&apos;s spot comes up are Will Fuller of Notre Dame and Baylor&apos;s Corey Coleman. 
Though receiver is clearly Houston&apos;s biggest need, there&apos;s certainly no guarantee the Texans will use their first pick on the position. 
The Texans have a strong history with taking receivers in the first round. 
Hopkins was the 27th pick in the 2013 draft and has started every game in his three-year career. He came to Houston 10 years after the Texans took Andre Johnson with the third overall pick in 2003. Johnson was a seven-time Pro Bowler who spent 12 years with the Texans and is the team&apos;s all-time leading receiver with 13,597 yards.

The consensus seems to be that the Texans will select a wide receiver if they stay at the No. 22 spot. However, the question is whether they will go for a deep threat or a polished route-runner with good hands.

The Other Texans Defensive End 
The Texans have J.J. Watt returning to lead their defense. But who&apos;ll be the team&apos;s other defensive end is far less clear. 
Jared Crick, who started 31 games opposite Watt in past two seasons, signed with Denver. 
They&apos;ll likely need to add a DE in the draft with Jeoffrey Pagan and Dan Pettinato as the only other defensive ends on the roster. Pagan appeared in six games last season and had just one tackle, and Pettinato did not appear in a game as a rookie.

Brown&apos;s Progress 
Left tackle Duane Brown, Houston&apos;s starter since 2008, tore a quad muscle in the regular-season finale and likely won&apos;t be ready for the start of training camp. 
But he should be ready for the season opener. Even if he is, it couldn&apos;t hurt for Houston to add depth on the offensive line to help protect the new $72 million quarterback. 
Defense First? 
Houston&apos;s biggest need is on offense, but it wouldn&apos;t be a surprise if the Texans went with defense instead. 
The Texans have selected a defensive player with their first-round pick in 10 of 14 drafts. 
Their first-ever draft pick was quarterback David Carr, but they drafted defensive players the other two times they had the top overall spot, adding end Mario Williams in 2006 and outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney in 2014. 
They also took a defender with their first pick last year, Wake Forest cornerback Kevin Johnson.

Here&apos;s USA Today Sports look at the top wide receivers (and one tight end) available: 
1. Laquon Treadwell, Ole Miss 
As his 40-yard dash time (4.63 seconds at his pro day) proved, Treadwell is not a burner. But he doesn’t have to be. He’s excellent at using his large frame to overpower and leverage cornerbacks into giving up plays. He has reliable hands, and if there’s any concern about his speed, just watch how he made plays against some of the top defenses in the SEC, such as his five-catch, 80-yard, one-touchdown performance against Alabama last September.

2. Corey Coleman, Baylor 
The NFL squad that picks Coleman is going to have to understand that his route tree will be limited and that he lacks the ideal size (5-foot-11, 194 pounds) to play at the next level. But Coleman is an intriguing prospect because of his explosion off the line of scrimmage and his ability to produce in the deep passing game. That production is due in part to the offense the Bears run, but it’s hard to argue with the numbers: Coleman led the nation with 20 receiving scores. 
3. Josh Doctson, TCU 
With 36.5% of TCU’s targets in 2015, Doctson is used to be a team’s No. 1 receiver. In the pros, he might be better served as a second target in an NFL offense. One of his best strengths is an ability to win on 50-50 passes, thanks to strong hands and a 41-inch vertical leap. His next quarterback should love that about him. One thing Doctson could improve on is his physique. He’s got the size at 6-foot-2, but at 202 pounds, he&apos;ll have his timing and routes disrupted by physical cornerbacks. 
4. (TE) Hunter Henry, Arkansas 
Thanks to a solid overall skill set, Henry should be an instant contributor from Week 1. He’s productive both in the passing game and as a blocker. He has enough speed to be a mismatch against most linebackers, and he’s too big (6-foot-5, 250 pounds) for safeties to handle him. But perhaps his best asset is his hands. He’s as consistent as it gets with tight ends, not registering one drop this season. He made numerous plays in traffic on the way to a 51-catch, 739-yard, three-touchdown season in 2015. TOP DEFENSIVE ENDS 
Here&apos;s USA Today Sports look at the top five defensive ends available: 
1. Joey Bosa, Ohio State 
A three-year starter with the Buckeyes, Bosa is the most pro-ready defensive end after leaving the Buckeyes with 51 tackles for loss and 26 sacks for his career. Equipped with an excellent blend of size, power and quickness, Bosa appears to be one of the safer picks in the entire draft. Though his production dipped a bit in 2015 – going from 13.5 sacks the previous year to five – Bosa constantly saw double teams and improved as a run defender. He comes from a pedigree of first-round defensive ends, and should be an instant contributor on defense, no matter which team takes him.

2. DeForest Buckner, Oregon 
At 6-7, 291 pounds, Buckner has the massive frame fit for a 3-4 defensive end in the NFL. More than just a big body, he proved to be a constant disruptive force at Oregon and overpowered his opposition for 10.5 sacks last season. Buckner&apos;s build has earned him comparisons to former teammate Arik Armstead, who was selected No. 17 overall last year by the San Francisco 49ers. But Buckner&apos;s athleticism and motor should put him in position to be a top 10 pick. 
3. Shaq Lawson, Clemson 
The only questions about Lawson entering the NFL scouting combine focused on his athleticism. An ultra-productive career at Clemson showed that Lawson could make plays on the field. But a 40-yard dash time of 4.7 seconds (fourth-best among DEs) and a broad jump of 120 inches (tied for fifth-best among the position) put all those concerns to bed. Lawson played at multiple spots along Clemson’s defense, which should appeal to both 3-4 and 4-3 squads. He’s thick, powerful and sheds blockers with excellent use of his hands. 
4. Noah Spence, Eastern Kentucky 
He may be the most athletic defensive end in the entire draft, but there are serious questions about Spence after he copped up to two failed drug tests while at Ohio State, both for ecstasy. He spent time in rehab, was permanently banned from the Big Ten and transferred to Eastern Kentucky. With the Colonels, Spence recorded 22.5 tackles for loss and 13.5 sacks. His broad jump at the NFL scouting combine of 121 inches tied for third best among all DEs. He has all the physical tools franchises want in an edge rusher, but can he be trusted off the field? 
5. Kevin Dodd, Clemson 
Dodd may very well end up being the top defensive lineman of this class, but with only one year as a starter for the Tigers, it may be some time before he can become a consistent NFL pass rusher off the edge. The good news for Dodd is that once he entered the starting lineup – opposite Lawson – he put up monster numbers. But he was saving the best for last. In the National Championship Game against Alabama, Dodd tallied five tackles for loss and three sacks. The performance sent his draft stock soaring. A hamstring injury suffered in the 40-yard dash, however, is worth monitoring. TEXANS RIVALS 
Draft capsules for AFC South teams: 
5. JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS (5-11) 
LAST SEASON: Finished with losing record for seventh time in past eight years, and latest one dropped coach Gus Bradley&apos;s record to 12-36 in three seasons. Jaguars offered glimmer of hope that better days are ahead by showing some offensive prowess for first time since 2007. QB Blake Bortles and dynamic WRs Allen Hurns and Allen Robinson emerged as solid core of playmakers. But defense was team&apos;s downfall, prompting Bradley to fire coordinator Bob Babich after season. 
THEY NEED: LB, DE, S, CB, OL. 
THEY DON&apos;T NEED: QB, WR, RB, TE, DT. 
POSSIBLE FIRST PICK: CB/S Jalen Ramsey, Florida State; LB Myles Jack, UCLA; DE Joey Bosa, Ohio State; DE DeForest Buckner, Oregon. 
OUTLOOK: General manager Dave Caldwell has made it priority to upgrade defense. He signed DT Malik Jackson, S Tashaun Gipson and CB Prince Amukamara in free agency, adding to last year&apos;s class that included DE Jared Odrick, CB Davon House and LB Dan Skuta, but still needs more talent, depth and competition on that side of ball. It wouldn&apos;t be shocking to see Jags use six or more of their eight draft picks on defenders. 
15. TENNESSEE TITANS (3-13) 
LAST SEASON: Not even Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota could save Ken Whisenhunt&apos;s job, and he was fired after 1-6 start by owner determined to see better protection for rookie quarterback. Mike Mularkey made enough changes to earn job in January, even if he didn&apos;t win many more games. Winning just five times combined over past two years cost general manager Ruston Webster his job, too. 
THEY NEED: OT, WR, CB, DL, S, LB. 
THEY DON&apos;T NEED: QB, RB. 
POSSIBLE FIRST PICK: OT Ronnie Stanley, Notre Dame; OT Jack Conklin, Michigan State; WR Josh Doctson, TCU; CB Vernon Hargreaves, Florida. 
OUTLOOK: New GM Jon Robinson made one of biggest trades in NFL history two weeks before draft, swapping No. 1 overall pick to Rams and picking up three more picks in this draft. Robinson now has nine selections, including six in first 76 picks. He says he now can be as flexible; he wants to move back up from No. 15 or move around draft to keep rebuilding roster. Protecting last year&apos;s No. 2 pick overall, Mariota, by drafting another offensive tackle would help; QB missed four games to injury as rookie. Mariota needs more people to throw to, and defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau always can use more players. 
18. INDIANAPOLIS COLTS (8-8) 
LAST SEASON: Colts discovered what life without Andrew Luck is like — no playoffs. Luck regressed in Year 4, throwing 15 TD passes and 12 interceptions while missing nine games with injuries. Backup Matt Hasselbeck provided initial spark but retired in February. Indy&apos;s biggest problem was offensive line that allowed way too many hits. Defensively, Colts never found consistent pass rush and struggled to stop run. Result: .500 record in season Indy was projected to be Super Bowl contender. 
THEY NEED: OL, DL, LB, CB. 
THEY DON&apos;T NEED: WR, QB. 
POSSIBLE FIRST PICK: OT Taylor Decker, Ohio State; OT Jack Conklin, Michigan State; LB Leonard Floyd, Georgia; DE Shaq Lawson, Clemson; C Ryan Kelly, Alabama. 
OUTLOOK: GM Ryan Grigson provided offseason blueprint in February — fixing offensive line and pass rush. But salary-cap constraints didn&apos;t allow Colts to do much in free agency, so Grigson must find help in draft. Indy has significant needs on offensive line, especially guard and center, which could prompt Grigson to trade down and still find help. If Grigson stands pat, he could take right tackle or look for pass-rushing defensive lineman or linebacker. Another option would be finding cornerback to start opposite Pro Bowler Vontae Davis. DRAFT SLEEPERS 
By Arman Markazi, USA Today Sports 
Here is a breakdown of some of the top sleepers available for the 2016 NFL draft: 
QB Kevin Hogan, Stanford 
Many overlook him because of underwhelming numbers and a limited arm, but Hogan is a proven leader and winner. Succeeding Andrew Luck as a redshirt freshman with the Cardinal, Hogan stepped in and showed great maturity. He always seems to put his team in the best position to win and has a fairly high floor as an above-average backup. His ceiling is as a Kirk Cousins-type game-manager who can make timely plays with his arm and underestimated running ability (4.76 40-yard dash). Hogan might be the smartest and most-experienced quarterback in this class. Teammates at Stanford raved about the two-time team captain’s ability to command the huddle. He could go somewhere on Day 3 and immediately improve a team’s QB room.

RB Daniel Lasco, California 
He didn’t draw much attention until the East-West Shrine Game. Lasco was a team MVP and all-Pac-12 honorable mention as a junior, racking up almost 1,500 total yards and 14 touchdowns. He couldn’t stay healthy as a senior because of nagging hip and ankle injuries. Lasco had a stellar performance at the Shrine game, rushing for 62 yards. And at the combine he was a top performer in four of seven drills. Lasco has opened a lot of eyes and has a lot of scouts going back to the tape. He should be a valuable chess piece for a coach looking for a third-down back who can be a positive asset on special teams. 
WR Jordan Payton, UCLA 
In a deep class of wide receivers, Payton is outside most people’s top 15 to 20 at his position. Whether it’s his possession-receiver stigma or his perceived lack of athleticism, people don’t seem to love this player. He impressed during his week in Mobile, Ala., at the Senior Bowl with his consistent practice performances and had a noteworthy combine, running a 4.47 40 to erase doubts about his speed. He left UCLA as its all-time leader in receptions (201). A quarterback-friendly route-runner who has the ability to play slot and outside receiver at the next level, he could be picked somewhere on Day 3. 
OT Spencer Drango, Baylor 
It’s not often that a two-time all-America and all-conference player can be consider a “sleeper,” but Drango’s case is a bit different. Most evaluators don’t think he has the feet or athleticism to stay at his natural offensive tackle position and want to move him to guard. Drango does have the size and strength to be a nice power right tackle with the ability to kick in and play guard. At the Senior Bowl, he impressed people with his run-blocking skills and ability to hold his own against some of the best pass rushers in the country. A four-year starter, Drango has the experience and technique to play at the next level. 
OG/C Jack Allen, Michigan State 
An undersized center, Allen has to make up for his lack of stature with competitiveness, tenacity and proper technique. A strong run blocker with improving pass protection skills, Allen is an ideal fit in a zone running scheme where coaches will appreciate his leadership and smarts. A high school wrestling champ in Illinois, Allen has toughness and aggression in the middle and can anchor. He had a tough week at the Senior Bowl handling some of the bigger linemen, but on tape it is evident that this player, put in the right scheme, can be a positive asset to an offensive line group. He won’t hear his name until Day 3 of the draft, but whoever takes him will be glad they did. 
DE Yannick Ngakoue, Maryland 
Ngakoue improved every season and finished his junior year with a Maryland-record 131/2 sacks. The first-team all-Big Ten selection wreaked havoc on opposing offensive tackles with his athleticism off the edge and relentlessness to get after the ball. He lacks the ideal length as an edge player but makes up for it with a slippery ability to always be around the ball. He could go in the third or fourth round. 
DT Chris Jones, Mississippi State 
In one of the deeper defensive tackle classes in recent history, a player such as Jones might get lost in the shuffle. He could have done himself a service by going to school for another season, but he started every game and regained the form he showed as a freshman. He’s a solid defensive line prospect who can stop the run and pressure the quarterback from the pocket. He has quickness off the snap, strength at the point of attack and the ability to disrupt gap running schemes. Versatile Jones can be a valuable asset to a defensive line group. 
OLB Kyler Fackrell, Utah State 
The well-balanced defender can contribute in different roles, with his hand in the dirt or standing up. He has the length and motor to come off the edge and get after the quarterback and also has the athleticism and agility to drop into pass coverage and hold his own against a tight end or running back. Having gone through a torn anterior cruciate ligament as a junior, Fackrell returned to form as a senior and made multiple positive plays a game. At the Senior Bowl, he impressed decision-makers with his versatility. This flexibility combined with his potential as a pass rusher makes him an exciting prospect for all 32 clubs. 
ILB Tyler Matakevich, Temple 
The 2015 Nagurski and Bednarik Award winner, Matakevich was an ultra-productive linebacker at Temple. Not the biggest, strongest or fastest, he is a film junkie and student of the game who shows the desire to be great. He makes up for his lack of size and athleticism with great technique, instincts and preparation. The four-year starter accumulated more than 100 tackles every year and was a three-time first-team all-American Athletic Conference selection. His leadership and consistency helped turned a perennial loser into a conference contender. His physical traits might cap his potential, but the kid will give you everything he has. He might start off on special teams, but he has the potential to move into a bigger role. 
CB Tavon Young, Temple 
A small corner at 5-9, Young will be taken off certain draft boards right off the bat because of his stature. What he lacks in size he makes up in effort, athleticism and heart. A high school track star, Young translated his speed to the football field, shutting down opposing top receivers in the AAC. Starting games for the Owls since his true freshman year, Young was a huge asset for a program that took huge leaps from relative obscurity to double-digit victories. He was invited to the Senior Bowl and stood out in practices as a battle-hardened corner who had confidence going against players from the bigger programs. He showed the ability to play bigger, break up passes and make plays on the ball with ultra competitiveness. In the right system, he could be an asset in the slot and on special teams. 
S Miles Killebrew, Southern Utah 
Even though he’s from a small school, Killebrew is gaining traction as a big, long safety who plays violently and looks to punish pass-catchers. Still raw in coverage, he makes up for it with his toughness, tackling and physicality. A four-year starter, Killebrew was productive from the beginning and improved every season. At the Senior Bowl, he grabbed attention with his willingness to mix it up with talents from bigger conferences. He might have a future in the league similar to Mark Barron and Deone Bucannon as a hybrid linebacker who can match up with tight ends and running backs. Until he reaches his potential at safety, he could be a nice special-teams player. Share This Story

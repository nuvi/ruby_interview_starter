CLARKSVILLE, IN (WAVE) - Town leaders celebrated the opening of Court Avenue in Clarksville on Monday. 
It may be small, but the 800 foot extension links south Clarksville to Jeffersonville and Interstate 65. The new section of Court Avenue connects Woerner Avenue to Missouri Avenue. 
The road is expected to play a key role in the South Clarksville Redevelopment Plan by providing convenient access to the area.

A new redevelopment plan is focused on a 320-acre area that, studies show, could have the potential to attract $180 million in private investment. 
The plans are broken into two parts, transformation and transition. The transition side of things will be focused on residential areas, like near Stansifer Avenue and South Clark Blvd. 
The bulk of the transformation phase will be focused near the historic Colgate clock. The goal is to turn an industrial area into a destination with luxury apartments and restaurants with walk-ablestreets and bicycle trails.This story will be updated. Copyright 2016 WAVE 3 News .

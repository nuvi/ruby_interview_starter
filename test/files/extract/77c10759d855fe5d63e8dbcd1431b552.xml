Boy with inoperable brain tumor gets a Special Space By: Casey Wheeless Posted: Mon 2:42 PM, Apr 25, 2016 By: Casey Wheeless Special Spaces 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WVLT) -- It&apos;s not every day you see a 5-year-old excited about new decorations in a room, but A.J. Cucksey is not your every day boy. He&apos;s stronger, braver and more dedicated than kids his age. A.J. is living with an inoperable brain tumor. 
&quot;We had some tough times and through those times A.J.&apos;s motto was always keep smiling,&quot; said John Cucksey, A.J.&apos;s father. 
Diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor, A.J. doesn&apos;t let it slow him down. 
Special Spaces of Knoxville, Tennessee wanted to give A.J. and his family a break. 
&quot;We got here at about 8 in the morning and we sent A.J. and his family off for a day of fun,&quot; said Steve Winfree with Special Spaces. 
When they came back, the group of volunteers designed a new play room for A.J. and his sister Gia. 
UT Quarterback Josh Dobbs helped paint a checkerboard on A.J.&apos;s wall. 
&quot;I&apos;ve known A.J. for a couple of years now and Special Spaces reached out to me,&quot; said Dobbs. 
&quot;There&apos;s a lot of kids who look up to people in my position and it&apos;s always a joy for me to meet them and reach out to them,&quot; he said. 
It will give A.J. a place to be a normal kid: a kid who is &apos;Tennessee Tough&apos;. 
&quot;Just knowing that people care about him, it helps him stay positive,&quot; said John. 
Special Spaces partnered with Coldwell Banker; they raised all the money for the room. iHome Improvement donated their time and skills. Sentencing today in murder of Jeffrey Kebler of Clinton County

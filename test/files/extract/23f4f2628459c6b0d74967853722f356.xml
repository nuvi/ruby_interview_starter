The publication also added that Debbie Wanner is set to pursue her &quot;flirtmance&quot; with Nick Maiorano in &quot;Survivor 2016: Kaoh Rong.&quot; It has been revealed that it was not Debbie&apos;s strategy, but the woman views Nick as just &quot;really, really good looking.&quot; 
In other news, Khait, who was voted out on Day 13, has shared her thoughts about her exit from the competition. In her interview with Rob Cesternino of Rob Has a Website , Gondol&apos;s Khait said that her best bet was to come after Tai and set him up on the island, adding the the latter was likeable and would provide around camp. 
Khait also mentioned that Tai had been injured and she had been trying to show the others that they could not trust the latter. She added that he probably had an idol and they had caught him looking for it. Khait said that she tried to set Tai up as best as she could, adding that there was a good chance. 
Khait was the fifth contestant to be voted out from &quot;Survivor 2016: Kaoh Rong,&quot; following Alecia Holden, Liz Markham, Jennifer Lanzetti, and Darnell Hamilton. Overall, she stands as the sixth contestant to be eliminated, as Caleb Reynolds was medically evacuated due to severe dehydration on Day 9.

Sunday, April 24, 2016 Cisgender Males Most Likely To Strike In Bathroom There has never been a confirmed case in the United States of a transgender individual attacking someone in a public bathroom or shower. Over 95% of all cases related to restroom crime are committed by cisgender males dressed as men, often with beards and hairy arms. The rest of the culprits are cisgender females. This is an estimate based on over fifty cases reported in local news in the past ten years. If a crime is being committed in a public bathroom or shower, it is more likely being committed by a cisgender policeman , teacher , pastor , or U.S. Senator than by someone transgender. According to the data, if a crime is being committed in a public space and there is a transgender person involved, it is always the case that the transgender is the one being attacked . However, supporters of bathroom bills, legislation designed to ban transgender individuals from using the proper facilities corresponding to their gender identity, blatantly and callously ignore these statistics. There is ample evidence suggesting that proponents did not do their homework because the stories are in all the newspapers, literally. In other words, bathroom bills are supported by irrational fear and hatred – emotions that should be nowhere near leadership in a free society. Yet we see plenty of far right dogs today on the bathroom bandwagon. Transgender people have used the bathroom that they feel most comfortable with in the United States since the 1950&apos;s. Since no one blew the dog whistle, not one vile bigot had a clue what was going on. Crime did not increase because that is how a restroom situation works. You go in, you do your business, and you leave. Leaders who do not understand something so obvious need to retire from public life and move back to the family ranch to die in misery. Enemies of the free state cannot stand for someone to have control of their own body, hence their hatred of homosexual and transgender peoples. These social conservative germs are now learning that the rest of society is not buying their filthy ethos any longer and is putting up walls to isolate the disease. The grassroots reaction will culminate in the ultimate destruction of this cancer. Until then, any author of this fear-mongering routine should be put on notice that their days bilking as a public servant are numbered and rapidly dwindling. Posted by

Well, that didn’t take long. 
Less than two weeks after Microsoft confirmed that the Word Flow keyboard from Windows Phone would be coming to iPhone, it’s officially launched on the App Store . Microsoft touts that Word Flow offers tapping and swiping for input, suggestions for the next word that you’ll want to type (that get better over time), and the ability to predict the names of your contacts when you give it access to them. 
Also included with Word Flow is the ability to customize your keyboard. You can do so with one of the included images, or you can use your own photo. There are eight images included right now, but Microsoft says that it’ll keep adding more. 
Finally, Word Flow includes a one-handed Arc mode that you can activate with a swipe. Arc mode makes it easier to type with one hand on devices with large screens, and it also supports both tapping and swiping for input. 
I spent a few minutes playing with Word Flow, and it seems to work well so far. Both tapping and swiping are available, and Arc mode did make it easier type one-handed on my iPhone 6s Plus’s 5.5-inch display. If you’re not totally happy with Apple’s keyboard and would like a replacement that makes it easier to type with one hand, Word Flow is worth a look. You can get it from the App Store using the link below. Source:

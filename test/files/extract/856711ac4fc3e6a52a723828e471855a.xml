Wattstopper Products Named 2016 Consulting-Specifying Engineer’s Product of the Year Finalists PR Newswire
SAN JOSE, Calif., April 21, 2016
SAN JOSE, Calif. , April 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ – Legrand, North America announced today that the Wattstopper Wireless Receptacle Controls (WRC) series and Wattstopper FSP-201 low voltage outdoor occupancy and daylight sensor are finalists in Consulting-Specifying Engineer ‘s ( CSE ) Product of the Year Awards in the Lighting Controls category. The program recognizes top new products in the HVAC, fire/life safety, electrical, plumbing systems, and engineering markets.
“We are thrilled to hear that our wireless receptacle controls and next generation occupancy and daylight sensors have been chosen as finalists for the CSE Product of the Year awards. It is an honor to be recognized for quality and innovative solutions that can add value to every project design,” said Ryan Smillie , Product Line Manager for Wattstopper at Legrand, North America .
The WRC series and FSP-201 sensors help meet building performance goals, the latest energy code requirements, and are easy to specify, install, and set up:
Wattstopper WRC series extends occupancy-based lighting control to plug loads. It helps meet new ASHRAE 90.1 and California Title 24 requirements to switch off selected receptacles. The series is ideal in a variety of applications including commercial offices, classrooms, conference rooms, and copy rooms. It is the easiest, lowest cost retrofit solution for plug load controls as it utilizes RF technology and works with existing line voltage wiring. Wattstopper FSP-201 is a low voltage outdoor occupancy and daylight sensor that maximizes safety and security for areas such as parking facilities, gas stations, pedestrian pathways, and warehouses. It simplifies compliance with the latest ASHRAE 90.1 and California Title 24 garage and outdoor lighting control requirements. The sensor also reduces the number of components required within the fixture when used with 0-10V dimming LED drivers that provide an auxiliary power supply. Product finalists are featured in the publication’s April 2016 issue and will be voted on by CSE readers for Gold, Silver, Bronze Awards. Vote online on the CSE website now until June 30, 2016 .

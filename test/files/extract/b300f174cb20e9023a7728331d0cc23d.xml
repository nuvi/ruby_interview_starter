PlayStation Plus May 2016 free games may include Watch Dogs and Tetris Ultimate 25 News Two Ubisoft-published titles may soon be entering the PlayStation Plus ring starting in May. 
Sony is just a few days from revealing its lineup of free games for PlayStation Plus members in May 2016, but today, we’ve learned two Ubisoft titles may be going free through Sony’s promotion next month. 
The two Ubisoft games that might be going free are Watch Dogs and Tetris Ultimate, which popped up on HotUKdeals . The image shows just the PlayStation 4 selection of free PlayStation Plus games, so we don’t know what other games will be available on either PlayStation 3 or PlayStation Vita. 
Unfortunately, the screenshot that was taken of listing is small, which doesn’t allow us to check on its legitimacy. So for now, chalk this up as an alleged leak until Sony makes its official announcement. 
If you ask us, though, we don’t think lying about Watch Dogs and Tetris Ultimate becoming available on PlayStation Plus would be worth much. A much more industry-shattering announcement would be something like Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End going free as soon as it releases. In this case, if it doesn&apos;t turn out to be true, you&apos;ll be able to hear the shrugs and &quot;Oh well&quot;s of PlayStation fans around the world.

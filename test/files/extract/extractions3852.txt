Government demands cautious but quick investigation of mass fish deaths | VGP | April 25, 2016 10:48 AM &gt;&gt; Vung Ang Industrial Zone blamed for gigantic marine pollution Deputy PM Trinh Dinh Dung on Sunday had a fact-finding tour to Ky Ha Commune, Ky Anh Town of the central province of Ha Tinh following mysterious mass fish deaths along the central coast. Deputy PM Trinh Dinh Dung visits a farm in Ky Ha Commune, Ky Anh Town, Ha Tinh Province to inspect mass fish deaths on April 24, 2016. Tones of dead fish have been discovered on beaches of the central coast of Ha Tinh, Quang Tri, Quang Binh and Thua Thien-Hue, sparking anxiety among local residents over the past days. The Government pays special attention to this incident, said Deputy PM Dung while chairing a working session with Ha Tinh provincial leaders same day. He said that competent agencies were perplexed in identifying the causes and in overcoming the consequences due to the lack of experience and environmental control at production facilities. He tasked the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment to take prime responsibility and coordinate with relevant agencies to identify the reasons in a &quot;cautious and fast manner&quot;. If organizations, enterprises or individuals are found guilty, strict punishments will be applied without exceptions, he said. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development was asked to propose solutions to assist farmers to restore production. Relevant ministries and agencies could coordinate with foreign experts and institutions to seek the causes, Deputy PM Dung suggested. The Deputy PM also requested relevant provinces to submit full and precise damages and timely provide assistance for farmers to stabilize life. Enterprises, organizations and individuals must also coordinate closely with competent agencies and local authorities in investigations, he demanded. According to Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Vu Van Tam, the Ministry has dispatched a delegation to the localities on April 7 to take samples and supervise the sudden phenomenon. The samples are being analyzed and outcomes would be released within the next three to five days, he added. Viet Nam has a long coastline which provides livelihood to thousands of coastal dwellers. In the first quarter this year, the country earned US$1.47 billion from aquaculture exports, up 7.4% against the same period last year. The total figure in 2015 was estimated at US$6.7 billion, a year-on-year decrease of 14.5%.

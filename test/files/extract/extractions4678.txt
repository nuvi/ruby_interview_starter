The Associated Press   2:37 PM WARWICK, R.I. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is weighing in on Deflategate, saying &quot;Leave Tom Brady alone.&quot; Trump made his comments during a campaign appearance in Rhode Island on Monday, soon after a federal appeals court ruled the New England Patriots quarterback must serve a four-game suspension imposed by the NFL. Trump told hundreds of people at the rally that Brady is a &quot;great guy&quot; and &quot;it&apos;s enough.&quot; Rhode Island&apos;s primary is Tuesday. The two men have said they are friends, and they have golfed together. Brady last year displayed a &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; hat from the Trump campaign in his locker. He said at the time that he hoped Trump would win the presidency, but later said the comment was offhand and taken out of context.

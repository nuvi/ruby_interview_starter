New Delhi cancels visa given to Chinese dissident 25 Apr 2016, 1309 hrs IST , AGENCIES India has cancelled the visa given to a leading Chinese dissident to participate in a conference in Dharamsala, apparently after China objected to it. &quot;We have cancelled the visa given to Dolkun Isa,&quot; a Home Ministry spokesperson today said without elaborating further. Isa, a leader of World Uyghur Congress (WUC), who lives in Germany, had been invited for the conference being organised by US-based &apos;Initiatives for China&apos;. Reacting to the Indian move, Isa said, &quot;On April 23, I got a very short note by the Indian side that my visa is cancelled. There was no explanation.&quot; He said he did not know what exactly was the reason for it. &quot;May be because of Chinese pressure put on the Indian government. But, I do not know...I did not get any explanation from the Indian side,&quot; he said. India&apos;s decision last week to allow WUC leaders whom China regards as backers of terrorism in its volatile Muslim- dominated Xinjiang province had come in the backdrop of Beijing blocking India&apos;s bid to get Pathankot terror attack mastermind Masood Azhar designated as a terrorist by the UN. China&apos;s unhappiness about reports that Isa has been given the visa was reflected in Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying saying, &quot;What I want to point out is that Dolkun is a terrorist in red notice of the Interpol and Chinese police. Bringing him to justice is due obligation of relevant countries.&quot;

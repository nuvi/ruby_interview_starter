Hudson, Fierstein to lead cast of &apos;Hairspray Live!&apos; By MARK KENNEDYAP Drama Writer 
NEW YORK (AP) - Jennifer Hudson and Harvey Fierstein will headline the cast of NBC&apos;s &quot;Hairspray Live!&quot; on Dec. 7. 
Based on the cult John Waters movie set in 1960s Baltimore, the show concerns the full-figured Tracy Turnblad whose fondest wish is to appear on a local television dance program. 
Hudson, who will play Motormouth Maybelle, is currently in the Broadway revival of &quot;The Color Purple.&quot; She won an Oscar and Golden Globe in 2007 in the hit film &quot;Dreamgirls.&quot; 
Fierstein, who is also writing the teleplay, will cross-dress and play Edna Turnblad, Tracy&apos;s mother, a role he created and won a Tony Award for in the stage version of &quot;Hairspray.&quot; 
The new live musical will be directed for TV by Alex Rudzinski, who helmed &quot;Grease Live!&quot; Kenny Leon will direct the stage show. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. Search Local Businesses

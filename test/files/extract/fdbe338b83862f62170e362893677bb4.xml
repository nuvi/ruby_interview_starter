Analysis of Game of Thrones&apos; IMDB scores has revealed (oo-er) that episodes with nude scenes are rated lower than episodes with no naked women at all. 
Across all five seasons of the HBO drama , episodes with no nude scenes achieved an average rating of 9.1 out of 10, while those with one nude scene got an average score of 8.94 and those with multiple nude scenes got an average of 8.87.

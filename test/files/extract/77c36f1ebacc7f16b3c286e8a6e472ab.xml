The King of Fighters XIV enters the PS4 ring in August 25 News Fans of the series will be able to step into the ring as one of 50 fighters this Summer. 
2016 appears to be the year of incomplete fighting games as both Street Fighter 5 and Pokken Tournament left fans of the genre wanting more. This Summer, Atlus is hoping to return the fighting game genre in good standing as it’s announced The King of Fighters XIV will release exclusively on PlayStation 4 on August 23, 2016. 
Atlus will offer a special King of Fighters XIV will pre-order / Day One edition that will package the game in a collectible SteelBook that features series’ mainstay Kyo Kusanagi. The pubisher is also making the Classic Kyo DLC costume free during The King of Fighters XIV’s launch week. 
To celebrate The King of Fighters XIV release date announcement, Atlus has released two new trailers for the game, which you can view below. Daniel Perez Senior Editor

Mayor lights beacon for Queen’s 90th birthday Cllr Ailsa Gaskill-Jones, mayor of Winsford, and children from Over St John’s Primary School 0 comments 
A BEACON was lit in Winsford to celebrate the Queen’s 90th birthday. 
Winsford Town Council joined in with the national celebration on Thursday, April 21, by the lighting of a birthday beacon at Rilshaw Meadows, off Rilshaw Lane. 
The Beacon was lit at 7.30pm by Cllr Ailsa Gaskill-Jones, mayor of Winsford, as part of a short service of celebration. 
The service featured songs and poetry by children from Over St John’s Primary School and a personal message from HRH the Prince of Wales. 
Cllr Gaskill-Jones said: “It was a real privilege to light a beacon on behalf of the town to celebrate the Queen&apos;s birthday. Whilst only a short ceremony it was a really lovely event. 
“The children from Over St John&apos;s school sang beautifully and the contribution from the junior mayor and my chaplain Rev George Crowder also really added to the occasion. 
“A huge thank you to all involved in organising.&quot; 
Many different organisations from across the country took part in the celebration by lighting beacons, including town, parish and community councils and youth organisations. 
Beacons were lit at churches, on farms, country parks, village greens and on country estates. 
Lighthouses, The National Trust and English Heritage properties also took part.

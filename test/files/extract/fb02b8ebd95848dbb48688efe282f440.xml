 29 AM EDT SEIZURES AND EPILEPSY: RISK MAY START IN INFANCY WITH THIS 
(Mesa, AZ) ― April 25, 2016 – Ever since it has been commercially available, formula manufacturers have made umpteen attempts to equate formula with breast-milk. Since every new mom may not be able to nurse, feeding formula is the choice that most mothers make for their infants without even thinking about it. This problem is fixable, if the new mom is matched with a non-hospital based lactation consultant to explore every possible avenue. 
If nursing is not an option, the question then shifts to which type of formula is preferable? Soy and dairy based formulas are the problem here, because the same proteins get thrown at a developing immune system again and again, day after day. It is recommended to use a hydrolyzed formula like Nutramigen or Alimentum. These formulas are “pre-digested” and have less proteins for an infant’s delicate immune system to react to. 
A study done by a researcher in 2014 , looks at the influence that infant formula had on seizures in a population of autistic children. It hints at a surprising link between soy based formulae and seizures in children. Here’s what they found: 
**In autistic children fed soy-based formula, there was a 2.6-fold higher rate of febrile seizures (4.2% versus 1.6%). **There was a 2.1-fold higher rate of epilepsy comorbidity (3.6% versus 1.7%). **There was a 4.8-fold higher rate of simple partial seizures (1.2% versus 0.3%). **There was no relationship with IQ, age of seizure onset, infantile spasms and atonic, generalized tonic clonic, absence and complex partial seizures. 
From this study, the authors seem to blame phytoestrogen in soy for the lowering of the seizure threshold. Unfortunately, there is extremely scant evidence for any type of relationship between phytoestrogen and seizures in medical literature. 
However, there is a strong suggestion that soy-based formula played a big role in increasing the risk towards certain types of seizures. It is felt that minerals like manganese (known to be higher in formula) as well as a development of a food allergy due to repeated exposure to soy could cause seizures instead of the phytoestrogen. 
Either way, this would seem to be another reason why parents must shun formula and support exclusive breast-feeding for 3 months at the very least, but preferably for 6 to 12 months. 
About the author: Dr. James Bogash typically scans more than one hundred peer-reviewed medical journals per month, looking for the latest research on natural medicine, nutrition, disease prevention and disease management, especially as it relates to seizures and migraine headaches. 
With this knowledge, he helps readers find the cause of his or her problems, and ways by which he or she can prevent them from recurring, rather than focusing only on symptoms.

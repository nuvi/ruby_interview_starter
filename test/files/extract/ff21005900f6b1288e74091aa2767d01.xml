If the crimson-colored edifice doesn’t pique your interest, then the interiors surely will. It’s one of the very few edifices that puts your privacy and safety foremost. For instance, entry and exit to and from your room will only follow your biometrics. There’s no need of a room key! So is dining in Luks Cafe that’s reserved strictly for in-house guests. This all-day dining outlet serves premium meats, fish, and produce cooked with olive oil only. A fine selection of fine wine and spirits complete their beverage list with fresh juices and cocktails. The exclusive NESPRESSO coffee, on the other hand, is the perfect pair to their molecular gastronomy desserts. Photo by Earl D.C. Bracamonte 
An entry into any of its eleven loft suites is a step into the future. Decked in Turkish-inspired opulence, each loft has its own Jacuzzi pool and sauna facilities. Perfect for honeymoons, intimate huddles, or whenever you want to enjoy the peaceful bliss of solitude. Each suite has two glass-encased boudoirs with adjoining toilet &amp; bath stalls; that’s easily sealed to complete privacy with electric blinds. The pool waters are changed per guest visit, as the management is a stickler for hygiene and cleanliness. Photo by Earl D.C. Bracamonte 
Owned and operated by husband &amp; wife team, the couple revealed that the hotel is a replica of their family home and built because a lot of their friends and colleagues prodded them to replicate it. Shami Khokar and Badette Baco built the hotel bringing both their expertise to the fore. Shami is an electrical engineer and software developer while Badette is into interiors. So with him preoccupied with the structure and the technical/technological things running the place, she was busy fine-tuning the details with furniture and fixtures down to the table appointments, china, and glassware.

Luks is the Turkish word for luxurious. Thus, Luksloft literally means luxurious lofts. The predominant red and black colors are reflective of Shami’s roots, being a Russo-Turk raised in New York. The cafe’s blues and gold soften the halls solid crimson and black patterns. ”Luksloft creates a space that doesn’t exist. It’s for people to discover. It could also be a place to ‘hide’ in plain sight or one that could transport you to another place. Truth is, I sold my apartment in New York to build Luksloft,” shared Shami, after saying goodbye to his lucrative MCI Telecoms post. “I see a lot of good Filipino talent but also a lot of repression,” he observed.

After deciding to settle in Batangas, he opened a small BPO company and then built Luksloft right beside it. “The hotel is windowless because apertures bring in heat and dust. Red is a big color for the Turks. The walls are textured for a tactile feel. All the rooms throughout the five floors measure 650 sq.m, maximized by high ceilings and mirrors. Room entry is through face recognition only,” shared Badette, who also maintains pawnshop operations of her own. Photo by Earl D.C. Bracamonte 
An oversized luxurious sofa and chaise lounge greet guests alongside big screen LCD monitors with a sound bar selector, designer furnishings deck the suites with modern appliances that complement a fully-equipped kitchen. And despite ensconced in privacy, exceptionally high-speed Wi-Fi Internet connection will connect you with the rest of the world. 
The queen-sized beds are decked with memory foam mattresses, hypoallergenic pillows, as well as summer duvets and plush blankets. A vanity cabinet with blow dryers complete the walk-in closet concept.

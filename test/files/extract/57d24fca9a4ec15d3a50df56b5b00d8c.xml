Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 11:02 AM By Silvio Calabi Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 11:02 AM » Social News The speed limit on France’s national autoroutes is 130 kilometers per hour, 80 MPH, and it seems to be religiously observed — at least up in Normandy, where I’ve not seen the sort of high-velocity traffic that flies along the British motorways, just across the Channel to the north. However, British and French drivers both keep impressive lane discipline (something that’s disappeared from American highways). French busses are governed to a maximum of 100 KPH, and they’re fitted with Breathalyzer interlocks. After the ignition has been off for 30 minutes, in order to restart his engine a bus driver must show he has no alcohol in his bloodstream by blowing into a tube. Busses are prohibited from the passing lanes, and from 6 p.m. on Friday to 6 p.m. on Sunday large trucks are banned from France’s highways, with exceptions for perishable cargoes. Like us, the French drive on the right, which must be a problem for British tourists who come down through the Chunnel in their own cars. (And also for the French who encounter them. But the Frogs and the Pommes have been butting heads, if not bumpers, for centuries.) While rural traffic is calm and orderly, driving in Paris demands nerves of steel and selective vision. Right of way? Never heard of it. The trick is to avoid eye contact with other drivers and just go, while motorbikes and scooters swarm about on all sides. Even Italians would be impressed. Paris’s cabbies are especially good at cutting through the chaos; they also seem to be uniformly courteous and well dressed, and their taxis are clean and well maintained. Oil prices have come down in Europe too, but French gas still costs the equivalent of about $6 per gallon, which helps explain the popularity of smallish four-cylinder cars here. Unlike neighboring Britain, where we see a lot of familiar nameplates — Ford, Jaguar, Land Rover, all the German, Japanese and Korean makes — in France most cars are domestic brands that disappeared from the US long ago: Peugeot, Citroen, Renault. Those three are moving their production into Eastern Europe, where labor is cheaper. This is causing unemployment and consternation at home, and may boost the sales of imports. For now, though, the most popular non-French cars in France seem to be VWs, with Toyota and Nissan close behind. That’s in the countryside. In Paris the streets are choked with BMWs, Mercedes-Benzes and Audis, all of them black. Paris (with less Middle Eastern and Russian money) isn’t as car-crazy as London, where Bugatti Veyrons are almost a daily sighting, but near the Eiffel Tower a handful of exotics, mostly droptop Ferraris, gather on sunny days. The drivers put up signs offering rides around the city. The most remarkable car I’ve seen here was a Bentayga, Bentley’s brand-new SUV. (I couldn’t tell whether it had the optional $160,000 Breitling clock on board.) The French appreciate elegance, so I’ve also spotted four Aston Martins, including an ultra-rare four-door Rapide. That one, though, was finished in matte olive drab, making it the ugliest most beautiful sedan on earth. Big SUVs are scarce, but Parisians love the style of the small Range Rover, the chic Evoque, and they’re everywhere. I did see one Chevy Tahoe — trundling across the Place de la Concorde, near the American embassy, it stood out like a covered wagon. The most popular American car in Paris, by far? The darling of all western European cities, the clean-running, silent, all-electric Tesla Model S. Speaking of which: Last Saturday the streets of central Paris were buzzing, literally, with round 7 of the 2016 Formula E series, the high-intensity world championship for electric racecars. Brazilian Lucas di Grassi, who drove his ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport to victory, told the media: “The concept of Formula E is to promote electric, environmentally friendly technology. The market for electric vehicles is mainly in downtown cities. If you look at cities that we race in around the world to promote the message of Formula E, Paris is for sure in the top three.” France, by the way, gets more than 75 percent of its electricity from nuclear energy, not coal. On the day before the race — on April 22, Earth Day — here in this city, officials from 175 countries including our own had signed the Paris Climate Accord, agreeing to limit carbon pollution and, it is hoped, global climate disruption. Meanwhile, France is trying to ban the sale of older scooters and motorbikes, because of their tailpipe emissions, and Holland and Norway are proposing to halt sales of new gas and diesel vehicles outright by 2025. Other countries are pondering similar steps. Do we see a trend emerging? — Silvio Calabi reviews the latest from Detroit, Munich, Yokohama, Gothenburg, Crewe, Seoul and wherever else interesting cars are born.

Strong turnout for Spring Up the Bluff BY Ryan Murphy | April 25, 2016 Home › News › Regional News (Murphy/KNEB/RRN) 
Yesterday concluded National Parks Week, and dozens of runners convened at Scotts Bluff National Monument to bring the week-long festivities to an end. 
For the 2nd straight year, the NEXT Young Professionals hosted ‘Spring Up the Bluff’– a relay race that allowed teams of up to 6 team members to run up to the top of the Monument on Summit Road. 
More than 40 participants braved the howling winds and a light rain, but it was all for a great cause. Proceeds from this year’s race will go back to the Monument in their donation fund so rangers can continue to deliver top-notch programming throughout the summer. 
Race Organizer Mason Stover says the only thing he could have wished for was the weather to cooperate a little better. 
Monument Physical Therapy was on hand to distribute water bottles and ensure nobody tweaked anything or rolled an ankle while running. 
The NEXT Young Professionals will also be busy next weekend as they host their annual progressive dinner tour . Stover says that tickets are still available and include an appetizer, main course, and desert at 3 different restaurants throughout the area. © 2016 Nebraska Rural Radio Association.

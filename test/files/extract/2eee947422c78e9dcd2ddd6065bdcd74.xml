With messy-hair season off to a beautiful start , you might feel a sudden yearning for waist-length waves, but if it’s true laissez-faire bliss you’re after, the It-Brits have a monopoly on the ultimate wash-and-go chop. 
Alexa Chung recently trimmed her above-the-shoulder layers to a blunt chin-length cut that looks even better with a few air-dried flyaways , while Stacy Martin rang in the new year with an impish new crop that she’s maintained at a constant jaw-grazing length. Also getting a jump on the summer months, Emma Watson parted with a few inches for an ombré bob with built-in beachy appeal. 
Above, three ways to navigate the sunny season with a warm breeze on the back of your neck.

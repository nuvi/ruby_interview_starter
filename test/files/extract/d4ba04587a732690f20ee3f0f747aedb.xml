Bangladesh Bangladesh is introducing a law with provision to impeach Supreme Court judges if allegation of misconduct or incapacity is proved. The Cabinet, with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair, approved in principle on Monday a draft of the ‘Supreme Court Judge (Investigation Act) 2016’, that, once passed, will empower the Parliament to impeach a judge. The approval was made under a constitutional obligation as Parliament in September 2014 had unanimously passed the 16th constitutional amendment bill, empowering the Parliament to remove Supreme Court judges. Explaining the law in the making, Cabinet Secretary Mohammad Shafiul Alam said the Cabinet will give its final nod to the draft after discussion with the stakeholders—the Supreme Court judges. The draft law says any citizen with evidence will be able to submit allegations of misconduct or incapacity against a Supreme Court judge to the Speaker of Parliament. A 10-member parliamentary body will investigate the allegations. The Speaker will then form a high-powered committee with former a Supreme Court judge, a former Attorney-General and noted jurists to review the primary report. The committee’s findings will be placed before Parliament which will forward its recommendations to the President for necessary action.

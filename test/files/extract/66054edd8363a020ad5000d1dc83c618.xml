Protesters Bring Boxes of Petitions Demanding Repeal of NC &apos;Bathroom Law&apos; Storyful 25 April 2016 Activists converged on the North Carolina legislative building in Raleigh on Monday, April 25, to deliver petitions asking for the so-called “bathroom law” to be repealed. Lawmakers were in session for the first time on Monday since passing House Bill 2, which requires people to use the bathroom assigned to their birth gender. The LGBT community opposes the law as anti-transgender.
Local reports state the activists brought about 20 boxes of petitions signed by those wanting the law repealed. The boxes of petitions can be seen in this video. A group of Democrats also on Monday filed a bill that would repeal House Bill 2.
North Carolina’s law has triggered a political debate over use of public bathrooms by transgendered people. House Bill 2 supporters state the law and ones similar to it protect women and children from men entering women’s bathrooms.
Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz has supported laws similar to House Bill 2, while front-runner Donald Trump has said people should use the bathroom associated with the gender they identify with. Musicians, such as Bruce Springsteen, canceled events in North Carolina because of the bill’s passage.
Meanwhile, retailer Target issued a policy stating people should use the bathroom for whichever gender they identify with, which has sparked backlash from conservative groups, who have promised to boycott the store. Credit: Instagram/Alexandra Bolles

Pub to close to undergo £1m refurbishment REVAMP: The Kings Head 0 comments 
A PUB is set to close while it undergoes a £1m renovation to completely overhaul its restaurant, bar and accommodation. 
The Kings Head in Richmond dates back 300 years, and was bought earlier this year by award-winning Coaching Inn Group. It will close its doors for seven weeks from Monday, May 3 as it undergoes the first phase of its refurbishment, which will include a number of structural repairs as well as cosmetic changes. 
Hotel manager, Fred Oxlade, said: “As a much loved iconic local landmark, we wanted to maximise our prime location to ensure we are known as the go-to-place in Richmond for family-friendly relaxed all day dining.

“The next seven weeks will see major work conducted on the property to breathe a new lease of life into the historic coaching inn, whilst maintaining its Georgian architecture. 
&quot;The plans look fantastic and we’re very excited to be introducing our new eatery and coffee house concept, which will see the introduction of locally sourced food and our popular sharing menu.” 
The Kings Head is currently recruiting 30 additional new staff members. Share:

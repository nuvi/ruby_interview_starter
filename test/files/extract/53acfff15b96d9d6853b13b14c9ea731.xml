Educators and students from Portland State University Department of Computer Science and the Lincoln High School Coding Club in Portland, OR have teamed up with industry professionals to organize the Portland CyberPatriot Camp , which will take place at Lincoln High from July 18 to 22. 
The week-long summer camp is &quot;designed for students interested in learning about cyber security, but who do not have experience or prior training in this field,&quot; according to a news release. The camp&apos;s design and core curriculum is based on the Air Force Association CyberPatriot Camp Program . Students will get a hands-on introduction to principles of cybersecurity, which can help prepare them for internships in cybersecurity and further cybersecurity activities at the high school level, such as &quot;capture the flag&quot; competitions. They will also have the opportunity to attend a networking reception with security business professionals at the conclusion of the camp. 
&quot;We wanted to organize this camp to give local high school students an opportunity to learn about this exciting field and participate in hands-on classes with some of the cyber security industry experts who are working here in Portland,&quot; said Charlie Kawasaki, CEO of Software Diligence Services and one of the camp&apos;s organizers, in a prepared statement. 
Portland CyberPatriot Camp topics and activities include: Introduction to cyber security and ethics; Introduction to VMWare Player; Hands-on security configuration of Windows and Ubuntu operating systems; Mock cyber competition; Guest speakers; and Networking reception with security business professionals. 
&quot;Cyber security is one of today&apos;s hottest technical fields, with some experts forecasting a shortage of up to 1 million of trained professionals in the coming years,&quot; said Kawasaki. &quot;Careers in cyber security can be incredibly rewarding, high paying and are in demand worldwide in just about every industry.&quot;

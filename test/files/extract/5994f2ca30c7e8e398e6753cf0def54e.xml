This Friday at 5:30pm, we’re partnering with the Bus Project to host America’s Next Top Candidate at McMenamin’s Mission Theatre. America’s Next Top Candidate will be an entertaining night of whacky contests and displays of talent, featuring leading candidates for Oregon Secretary of State and Mayor of Portland. We’ll even (occasionally) hear from the candidates on relevant social justice issues, like reducing barriers to voting, institutional racism, and access to a quality education.

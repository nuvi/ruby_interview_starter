The Houston Astros have gotten downright desperate as their starting rotation has been unable to eat up innings. Houston as recalled right-handed pitcher Michael Feliz to help fill in the bullpen and optioned Jake Marisnick to Triple-A Fresno, as first reported by the Houston Chronicle&apos;s Angel Verdejo, Jr. Felix recalled...Marisnick going down to triple A. Need the arms. #Astros — Angel Verdejo Jr. (@ahverdejo) April 25, 2016 
The Houston Astros are tied for the second-most innings pitched by relief pitchers in the American League with 65 1/3 innings. Houston&apos;s relief pitchers had to make 13 separate appearances during the Red Sox series alone. It&apos;s easy to see why the Astros needed some help in the bullpen. 
It&apos;s still surprising to see Marisnick is the odd man out, but that is the nature of the Astros current roster. Rookies do not litter the roster anymore as the easy target to be sent down. 
Jake Marisnick has appeared in 12 games so far in 2016, mostly in a backup role to pinch hit or run. He is currently batting .100 (1x10) with a walk and six strikeouts. This trip to the minors may help Marisnick by giving him more playing time with the Grizzlies. 
Feliz won the final spot in the Astros bullpen to start the season. He was used once in long relief after Collin McHugh only lasted 1/3 of an inning on April 6. Feliz pitched 4 1/3 innings, allowing six earned runs on seven hits. 
Feliz is 1-0 with a 9.72 ERA in two starts with Triple-A Fresno. More from The Crawfish Boxes

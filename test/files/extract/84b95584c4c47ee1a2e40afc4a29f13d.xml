Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 9:14 AM Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 9:14 AM Luke Burch (Hiland) had another big day at the plate as he went 3-for-5 with two runs scored and two stolen bases and Mason Mamarella (Dover) finished with two hits as Kent State (30-10, 12-3) took down Ohio (17-22, 5-10) 6-5 on Sunday to complete its second-straight conference sweep and its fifth series sweep of the season. The team added room to its first place lead in the conference as contender Ball State lost on Sunday and Miami completed a non-conference series. Kent State will now travel to Penn State on Wednesday for a 6:30 p.m. game before returning home to host Miami next weekend. Times Reporter

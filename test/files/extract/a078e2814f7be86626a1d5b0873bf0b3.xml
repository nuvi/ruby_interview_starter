Mark Stoneman makes 15th first-class century in Durham&apos;s clash with Middlesex 25 Apr 2016 17:53 
Mark Stoneman amassed 139 not out on a painfully cold day two between hosts Durham and Middlesex in Specsavers County Championship Division One. 
With a bitter wind blowing at Chester-le-Street that led to some Middlesex players fielding in beanie hats, Stoneman kept warm by dominating the visiting attack. 
He and Jack Burnham (61) put on 131 for the third wicket to aid a stumps score of 295 for four. 
Middlesex earlier topped up their overnight 358 for seven to 389 all out, falling just short of maximum batting points. 
Ben Stokes returned four for 80 but scored only nine with the bat. Having earlier ousted Steven Finn, Stokes fell to his England team-mate. 
It was cold and wet across the whole country, including at The Oval where Surrey took maximum batting points by moving from 394 for five overnight to 463 all out thanks latterly to Zafar Ansari&apos;s 53 on his return from a serious thumb injury while Tim Groenewald returned five for 94. 
Somerset reached 99 for one before rain intervened, veteran Marcus Trescothick unbeaten on 68. 
England&apos;s Adil Rashid struck 63 to help holders Yorkshire to a fourth batting point as they closed on 368 for nine versus Warwickshire at Edgbaston where all Monday&apos;s action came after lunch. 
Jack Leaning could add only one to his overnight 50 but Gary Ballance, resuming on the same score, advanced to 68 before Rashid took over with support from Steven Patterson who hit a breezy 62 not out. 
In Division Two England&apos;s Moeen Ali made 74 against Gloucestershire on his first appearance of the season for Worcestershire. 
Moeen&apos;s fifty came before Joe Clarke (103 not out) and Ben Cox (59 no) added an unbroken 135 for the sixth wicket in a score of 297 for five. 
That was in reply to Gloucestershire&apos;s 380 all out, aided by Hamish Marshall&apos;s 135 and 84 from fellow Kiwi Kieran Noema-Barnett who shared 209 for the sixth wicket. Noema-Barnett did not add to his overnight score but Marshall managed 12 more on day two. 
A last-wicket stand of 63 between Andrew Salter and Timm van der Gugten helped Glamorgan post 377 all out versus hosts Derbyshire. 
The Welsh county resumed on 308 for six but lost two wickets without addition. Yet from 314 for nine, Tony Palladino having taken his fifth wicket, Van der Gugten made 36 and Salter 25 not out to secure a fourth batting point. 
The weather forced an early close with Derbyshire on 98 for two, Michael Hogan grabbing both wickets. 
There were nine overs of play at Chelmsford with Essex bagging a fourth batting point against Northamptonshire by advancing from 335 for three after day one. Dan Lawrence joined Ravi Bopara on an unbeaten fifty, meaning all of the hosts&apos; top five hit half-centuries. 
Just 6.3 overs were possible at Grace Road where Kent moved from 227 for seven to 233 for eight with Matt Coles becoming Clint McKay&apos;s third wicket of the innings. Sport Sites

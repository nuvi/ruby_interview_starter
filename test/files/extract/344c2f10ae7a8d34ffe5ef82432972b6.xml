Church and Jay Leno surprise fallen officer&apos;s widow By: Caitlin Centner Posted: Mon 2:45 PM, Apr 25, 2016 By: Caitlin Centner / Headlines List / Article 
RICHMOND, Ky. (WKYT) - It&apos;s been a tough five months for the family of a fallen Richmond police officer. Officer Daniel Ellis was shot and killed during a robbery investigation in November. Ever since then, the community has found ways to support his family. Saturday, Saint Mark Roman Catholic Church teamed up with a famous comedian to cheer up his widow, Katie Ellis. 
Jay Leno was in Richmond Saturday night, joking around with Father Jim like they were old friends. The night of laughter was a great time for Katie Ellis, wife of fallen police officer Daniel Ellis. 
&quot;It&apos;s bittersweet, ya know? I&apos;d rather just be sitting on the couch with Daniel, but that can&apos;t happen,&quot; Ellis said. &quot;So, I feel like the community is really healing with me.&quot; 
Evening Among Friends, on its last year, benefits the St. Mark church and school, as well as the Officer Daniel Ellis Memorial Foundation. 
&quot;You know everybody thinks the world is such a terrible place, but there are more good people than there are bad people and we hear about the bad people. You know, it&apos;s like this police officer that was killed in the line of duty he was a good man,&quot; Jay Leno, talk show host, said. 
Father Jim Sichko said, &quot;And let&apos;s not forget the whole incident started at St. Mark. A kindergarten teacher was robbed by that individual, that assailant. Daniel, Officer Ellis was coming to assist us.&quot; 
Sichko surprised Ellis with an all-expense paid trip to Disney world for she and her three-year-old son, Luke. That wasn&apos;t the only surprise of the night. Leno surprised her with $10,000 for Luke&apos;s college fund. 
&quot;I&apos;d like to see him go to college,&quot; Leno said. &quot;Police officers don&apos;t make enough money anyway and when you lose the bread winner of the family it&apos;s the saddest thing in the world.&quot; 
&quot;It is very surreal,&quot; Ellis said. &quot;We&apos;re just regular people that have unfortunately been put in this position and we lost Daniel and we&apos;re very honored that someone like Jay Leno would care just a little, ya know? It means the world.&quot; 
Ellis says she can&apos;t thank the community enough for all the support, and a night full of surprises and laughter with Leno.

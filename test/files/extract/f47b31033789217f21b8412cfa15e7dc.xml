Shell concept car reduces CO2 Shell concept car reduces CO2 
Shell presented a new climate-friendly concept city car which can reduce by 34% primary energy use in the road transport sector in the UK. It weighs only 550 kg. 

Shell’s three seats car was created though a process of “co-engineering” where car structure, engine design and lubricants are all created together. 
The Shell Concept Car needs 50% less energy for its building and running than a typical small family car available, and 69% less than a typical sports utility vehicle available in the UK. It aims to minimise the overall energy lifecycle use impacts. During tests Shell’s concept car use in steady state and urban driving styles showed consumption of 2.64 lit per 100km at 70 km/hour. This represents less 4.67g CO 2 /km emitted on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). 
“This is a significant automobile engineering milestone. Energy use and climate change are major issues for society. This project shows that if we use the best of today’s technology, including cutting edge lubricants science, we could potentially have a major impact on energy use and reduce CO 2 emissions,” explains Mark Gainsborough, Executive Vice-President of Shell’s global lubricants businesses which backed this project. 
The Shell Concept Car was also independently tested at a UK certified automotive facility alongside a range of other cars under comparable conditions to measure fuel economy and CO 2 emissions. Its NEDC test results indicate it produced lower CO 2 emissions than both a typical petrol-powered city car (28%) and a hybrid car (32%). 
This concept car is based on the Gordon Murray Design T.25 city car of 2010, for which Shell produced a prototype oil to improve the car’s energy efficiency. The car also uses recycled carbon fibre for its body that can be assembled for a quarter of the price of a conventional steel car and almost all the car can be recycled at the end of its life.

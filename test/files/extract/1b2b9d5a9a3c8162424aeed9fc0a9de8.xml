Ottawa researchers discover new treatment target for deadly brain cancer Posted on 4/25/2016 2:12:00 PM by Alison Sandor 
A team of researchers at the Ottawa Hospital have found a potential new treatment for a deadly and uncurable brain cancer. 
Dr. Michael Rudnicki, the director of the Regenerative Medicine Program at the Ottawa Hospital said they&apos;ve basically identified what they believe is the Achilles&apos; Heel of the deadly glioblastoma tumour. This type of cancer is resistant to radiation and chemotherapy and is very difficult to remove through surgery. Patients ahve a life-expectancy of 16 months. 
&quot;We&apos;re able to show that with human stem cells of this cancer, that by blocking the function of this protein that is the Achilles&apos; Heel, called OSMR, that we could prevent the formation and growth of the tumours,&quot; said Rudnicki. 
&quot;This is a really important advancement in our understanding that suggests this is an important target that we need to pay attention to,&quot; he added. &quot;Ideally if we could design drugs that block the function of this protein, this could be used clinically to treat the tumour.&quot; 
Researchers say this discovery could pave the way for more effective treatments for not only glioblastomas, but breast, lung and cervical cancers. 
The research was published Monday in the journal Nature Neuroscience.

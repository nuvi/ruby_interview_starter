Kiwi Henry Cooper hammers century as Broad Oak win in Drakes Huddersfield Premiership 18:00, 25 Apr 2016 Successive wins as Colne Valley side soar Shares Get daily news by email Drakes League Cricket. Holmfirth v Meltham. Holmfirth bowler, Matthew Gummerson. 
Kiwi Henry Cooper hammered 125 to help Broad Oak to their second successive win in the Drakes Huddersfield League Premiership. 
The Colne Valley side, who defeated Armitage Bridge the previous day, knocked off 189-8 at Cawthorne to score a seven-wicket win. 
Iqbal Khan scored 104 for Cawthorne, while Alex Slack picked up four for 46 for the visitors. 
The result never seemed in doubt, however, as Cooper – the 23-year-old from Northland in New Zealand, at the very top of the North Island – and Lee Baxter (42) gave the Oak a solid platform, despite Jake Rodgers taking three for 50. 
Skelmanthorpe also scored successive wins, following up their success at Elland with victory at champions Scholes. 
Opener and skipper James Noble put Scholes in a strong position with 65 and, with Kiwi Tom MacRury adding 41, they were looking set for a big total at 103-1. 
But Amar Rashid found a good length and line, allied to a bit of turn both ways, and he pegged the Chapelgate men to 191-9. 
Things looked bleak for the visitors when they slumped to 80-5 in reply, but Scholes couldn’t break a century stand between Luke Webster (44) and Zarak Khan, who finished on 79 not out to seal a four-wicket success.

Shelley bounced back from their defeat against Shepley by beating newly-promoted Armitage Bridge. 
Home side Shelley totalled 193 with Jack Hinchliffe, ex-Marsden man Mark Johnson and Kiwi Jaycob Curtling all taking three wickets. 
The Bridge could not get the job done with the bat, however, and they were dismissed for 154 as Tom Haytack, Jordan Geldart and Mo Bhoola all took three wickets for Shelley. 
Shepley recorded their second successive win, pummelling Kirkburton at Riley Lane. 
Dan Wood hit a half century as Shepley posted 233-9, Tom Burkinshaw adding 27 against his old club. 
Kirkburton skipper Craig Fletcher replied with an unbeaten 40, but Kirkburton lost Sam Evans for three following his 175 not out in their win at Hoylandswaine and no-one else could stay in as they were skittled for 80. 
Nasir Jamal claimed six for 38 to add to his six for 26 of the previous day, while skipper Danny Glover had three for 10. 
Delph &amp; Dobcross scored their second win and condemned Honley to defeat after Greg Buckley top scored with 71 in their 272, Lewis Kenworthy taking five for 62. 
Honley were never in the hunt as ex-Saddleworth opener Shakir Muhammad claimed five for 29, and the visitors were sent back for 148. 
Elland, who were unable to put out a second XI, lost by four wickets at home to Hoylandswaine. 
Siraj Sajid top scored with 40 in Elland’s 112 all out – Michael Cranmer and Richard Wilkinson taking three wickets apiece. 
Alistair Finn took three wickets in reply, but Ryan Robinson saw Swaine home with 25 not out. 
Golcar lost for the second time, going down by three wickets at home to Barkisland after totalling 145 all out – Matt Steers claiming five for 44. 
Jamie Summerscales hit 40 and skipper Darren Robinson 43 not out as Barkisland got the win on 147-7.

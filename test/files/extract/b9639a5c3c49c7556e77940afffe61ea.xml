25 April 2016 - 5:33pm Updated | posted by Rebecca Stewart Media iQ named &apos;best&apos; media owner to work with as IPA launches Media Owner Awards 2016 In partnership with the IPA 
Global analytics firm Media iQ has been voted as the &apos;best&apos; media owner to deal with by media agencies and digital specialists, according to the IPA’s Online Media Owner Survey. 
Over 92 per cent of respondents said they either agreed or strongly agreed that their overall experience of dealing with the company was positive; marking the highest score awarded to a media owner in the survey’s five-year history. 
The research asked over 300 members of the digital industry, including planners, strategists and media buyers to rate their experience of different companies in the space. 
The results coincide with the launch of the IPA&apos;s 2016 Media Owner Awards (MOA) which reward best practice from online media owners, with the aim of raising the overall digital standard. 
Coming just behind the number one choice were Collective, Unruly, RadiumOne and Captify which all achieved a score of over 80 per cent. While Media iQ led in the ad networks exchange and sales houses category, AOL Advertising continued to front the online pure plays with a score of 78.1 per cent with global radio leading crossover media owners with a similar score of over 78 per cent. 
In addition to to topping the overall survey, Media iQ came first in a further six &apos;categories&apos; in the research including Ease of Contact and Communication of New Opportunities, while Sky Digital Media noted an improvement of 10 percentage points or more across nine categories. Channel4.com has seen a decline of 10 percentage points or more across six metrics. 
The IPA&apos;s consultant head of media and emerging technology, Nigel Gwilliam, said: &quot;Coming top in only their second year on the survey is a fantastic achievement for Media iQ, especially given they backed it up with the lead place on six other categories. 
They are now setting the bar, but it is also great to see Yahoo and Sky Digital Media working hard on service levels, improving in 13 and 12 categories respectively.&quot; 
The IPA MOAs, which launched today, are based on the findings from the survey using combination of spring, autumn and year-on-year results as well as eight submission-based awards which are open to enter from today across areas such as Best Online Campaign and Best Technology. 
The shortlist will be announced in October and the winners will be revealed at a black-tie event on 15 November.

Wednesday, 2 March 2016 Nice - PaneOlio for Italian Aperitif and pizza There is a new spot in Nice for after work drinks, I do love an apero spot! And this one transports us back to Italy as for a very decent price of 6 euros you get a huge glass of wine and access to the buffet! Check out just how big the glasses are! And you can also have a beer or a mixed drink from what I understand like a Spritz or a beer or a soft drink. Read in for more about the new aperitivo spot on Jean Jaures called Paneolio run by a gang of young Italian guys. It really reminded me of my student days in Rome where we would go out of our way to go to aperitivo places that would feed us :) Here the apéro is from 5pm until 7.30pm daily (though I recommend going early as they run out towards the end). When I say the glasses of wine are big, they really are! There are places I spend more than 6€ here in Nice for a glass of wine and that doesn&apos;t include the food! So it is a very decent deal. I had the prosecco, G had the red. The red is OK not amazing, the prosecco is good and I had the white during another visit which is better than the red. You can go inside and serve yourself from these platters of food that do get refreshed. The first time I went they were on the bar, the second they were more outside in front of the serving window (they do pizza slices at least during the day and in the evening you can get full pizzas which we did the second visit - see further down). Focaccia, bruschetta with a kind of spinach pesto... Pizza and kind of Italian sausage roll things.... Here was our first platter. I am obsessed with their focaccia with cherry tomatoes! Salty but I love salt (and smart to make people order more wine) - really good and fluffy and yum. G liked the spinach pesto more than me, I liked it but found it very very spinachy (so if you like spinach you will love it). Their pizza was perfectly pleasant, the base is nice and light but charred and crispy - very good, utterly unexpected for an apéro dish. As you can see it is raining outside it was a horrid winter day but we were in the covered terrace part with heaters so we were fine. I had had a long long week and was just not in the mood to head straight home and sit around, so I was very happy to head out and eat and drink happily. We actually ate so much we didn&apos;t have dinner after! They then randomly came out with fresh pizza for us and here is when we realised how good the base is, not quite Neapolitan but thicker than a Roman base, but indeed with the char and crispy and layers of the Roman. And I wanted more focaccia :) Here is the covered terrace part of PaneOlio, it was jam-packed the second time I went, only a week later, so the word is getting out around Nice about this good deal. But I have also seen complaints about the buffet not being refilled and a perceived favouritism towards Italians who then get fresh pizzas (like we did the first time) but when the buffet is empty. So I think the PaneOlio guys will need to be a bit careful about that as it will cause them to get a reputation which might just be unfair as it may not have been done on purpose. Here is the full menu, there are starters including salads and platters, then a collection of pizzas and some pastas too. This is my second visit with colleagues and friends when my husband was away. This is the outdoors of Paneolio (bread oil) - you can see it is busier and just about make out the buffet spread. This is the left side with the covered terrace. We started by sitting outside but got cold later on and headed back inside. We both went for a glass of prosecco which was still as big :) This time there was fresh pizza &apos;rossa&apos; ie pizza with just tomato sauce, which is one of my favourite things ever. They still had the focaccia I love and this time I also grabbed a kind of sweet and savoury doughnut. My colleague had some of their mini sandwiches as well as this fascinating black rice thing in lettuce that we just couldn&apos;t quite wrap out heads around (but enjoyed). This is the random sweet and savoury doughnut. I asked the waiter what was in it and he said mozzarella and tomato so I assumed it would just be a salty dough but it was slightly sweet as if it was a standard doughnut but filled with savoury elements. Funny! But tasty :) Lovely view to the modern art museum though (the MAMAC) We enjoyed the beautiful sunset over the museum and the Coulée Verte and then headed inside. We got another drink and hit the buffet again as there was more pizza and some bruschette, including one with the strange but tasty black rice with garlic and courgette (I think!) And a pesto topped white pizza which was full of flavour with what I assume to be homemade pesto as the basil came through nice and strong. Again the pizza base is nice here. We then couldn&apos;t be bothered to leave and more friends had joined us so we just ordered some food for dinner. The two of us who had been there a while were maybe not so hungry after the big apéro we had but we still managed a few slices each :) We ordered a few pizzas to share - I chose the Buffalina with buffalo mozzarella which was enjoyed by all. Very different to my usual pizza places ( Les Amoureux and L&apos;Atelier de Julien ) so not to be compared to them, but very nice also in a different style. As I mentioned before they are more like Roman pizzas but a bit thicker, with a nice char. P went for the Puttanesca pizza which is usually a pasta so fun to see as a pizza with the olives, garlic, capers and anchovies on a red (tomato) sauce base. The is the Vegetariana, a veggie &apos;bianca&apos; pizza (ie just a mozzarella base without tomato sauce) with courgettes and aubergines. It was a bit heavier than the buffala one but very good too, the veggies were very nice. A closer look at the two pizzas I tasted, both of which were pleasant. Like I said, not Les Amoureux, more standard pizzas, less creative than my usual favourites I have mentioned (Les Amoureux and Julien), more standard, but nice. And my colleague&apos;s wife went for the porcini risotto which she liked :) Have you been to Paneolio? How did your visit go? Where else do you go in Nice for apéro? Paneolio

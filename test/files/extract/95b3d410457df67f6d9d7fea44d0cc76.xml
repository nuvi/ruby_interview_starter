Hannah’s poignant walk in memory of popular Wyre Forest teacher Share: 0 comments 
A PROOFREADER from Kidderminster will be lacing up her walking boots to help raise money for a charity close to her heart. 
Hannah Griffiths will be taking part in a 33-mile trek with her husband Matthew O’Donnell with the aim of raising £500 for the Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA), on Saturday, April 30. 
They are walking halfway around the Isle of Wight in memory of both their mothers. Hannah’s mum, Anne Griffiths, who died from the disease in August 2014. 
Mrs Griffiths was a special needs teacher, who worked at Offmore Primary School, St Barnabas First School, The Bewdley School, Stourport High School and other schools in the area. 
Hannah, aged 31, said: “I feel excited and nervous but I’m really glad to be walking for the MNDA. 
“Because a relatively small number of people are living with motor neurone disease, it gets very little press coverage. 
“Anything I can do to increase awareness and raise money to help find the cause and then a cure for this horrible disease will be worth the blisters. 
“Mum was exceptionally courageous in facing the disease and I’m really hoping to find her strength in the last miles of the walk. 
“Everyone who loved her still misses her, and the thought of a future without MND is what spurs me on. 
“The Ice Bucket Challenge raised an incredible amount of money for the MNDA in the weeks after Mum died in 2014 so if you’d like donate without having to chuck a bucket of ice over yourself this time, visit www.justgiving.com/Hannah-Griffiths-Walks or text IOWH66 £5 to 70070 to donate £5 in her memory.” 
She added that people will be able to make donations for around two weeks after Saturday’s walk. 
Motor neurone disease (MND) is a fatal rapidly progressing disease that affects the brain and spinal cord, attacking the nerves that control movement so muscles no longer work. 
The MNDA says it kills a third of people within a year and more than half within two years of diagnosis. It affects up to 5,000 adults in the UK at any one time and kills six people every day. There is no cure. 
Denise Davies, Head of Community Fundraising at the MNDA, said: “Without the amazing support of people like Hannah, the MND Association simply would not be able to provide its vital support services, fund research to find a cure and campaign and raise awareness of MND. 
“Together we are making a real difference for people affected by this devastating disease.” Share:

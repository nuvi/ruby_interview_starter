 17 AM EDT Microfluidic Device System Market 2016-2020 Industry exmined by Syndicate Market Research 
Microfluidics device system deals with the several systematic applications areas including medicine, cell biology research and protein crystallization. It is a developing scientific field having significant commercial potential. Microfluidic device system helps to reduce side effects and improve the efficacy of medical treatments. Scientifically, microfluidic study involves study of the behavior of fluids in micro-channels and technically, it deals with the manufacturing of microfluidics devices for applications. Microfluidic device system has many applications in other areas such as inkjet printers, blood-cell-separation equipment, biochemical assays, chemical synthesis, genetic analysis, drug screening, electrochromatography, surface micromachining, laser ablation and mechanical micromilling. 
Increasing demand of microfluidic device system from point of care testing and pharmaceutical industry are the major factors driving the microfluidic device system market. Rising demand of microfluidic device system in genomics and proteomics strongly associated with the growth of microfluidic device system market. However, harsh regulatory requirements may hamper the growth of this market.

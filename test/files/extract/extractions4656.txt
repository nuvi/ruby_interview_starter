THE first strike in the history of the NHS where junior doctors have walked out of accident and emergency units, urgent maternity services, resuscitation and mental health crisis teams, looks set to begin today (Tuesday, April 26). 
As the Gazette went to press on Monday, strike action looked poised to enter a new phase with no sign of agreement being reached between the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and the British Medical Association over the introduction of new junior doctor&apos;s contracts. 
Following earlier industrial action where emergency cover was not affected, the walk-outs are set to last two days (Tuesday and Wednesday) between 8am-5pm. 
Emma Coombe, a junior doctor of five years experience who works in pediatrics at Derriford Hospital, and lives in Sampford Peverell, will be joining colleagues on the picket line today. 
She said: &quot;Technically I am not working on Tuesday but I will be going to Plymouth to join the picket and support my fellow colleagues. Everyone I speak to would much prefer to resolve this, we would much rather be inside treating patients than stood outside on the picket line.&quot; 
She said it was unfair to classify the action as a &quot;withdrawal&quot; of emergency services as these would still be covered by &quot;the most senior doctors&quot; in the affected hospitals. &quot;Patients will not suffer as a result, in fact, the quality of care they receive may even be better, because they will be seen by very experienced professionals.&quot; 
She said: &quot;The government&apos;s election manifesto pledged to bring in a &apos;7-Day NHS&apos; may sound like a good idea, but they have not put aside any money for extra doctors so in effect, you will be spreading five days of doctors across seven days and that has to affect patient care.&quot; 
Katie Pass, a junior doctor in anaesthetics at North Devon District Hospital in Barnstaple will also be at a picket line outside the hospital in Barnstaple. 
She said: &quot;The Department of Health tells us that the new contract will improve patient safety – but we are gravely concerned it will actually adversely affect patient and doctor safety, and is unfair to doctors.&quot; 
She said the new contract would reduce current hours safeguards, which help ensure junior doctors are not routinely overworked. 
Dr Pass said: &quot;The government is not listening to our concerns.&quot; 
The NHS says it is working hard to ensure as few patients as possible are affected by the industrial action today and tomorrow but some services are likely to be busier than usual. 
Patients are being advised to choose the right service and attend A&amp;E only if it is essential.

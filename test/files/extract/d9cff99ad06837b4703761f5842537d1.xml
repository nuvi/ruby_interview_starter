WHY GIRLS? “Giving girls and women the chance to improve their own livelihoods is crucial to ending poverty for good… Businesses have a key role to play by using their skills and expertise to provide vital products and services, which are key to building prosperous societies.” 
~ Justine Greening, UK Secretary of State for Development, October 2014 
Girls who have an opportunity to reach their full potential make vibrant local economies possible. They’re motivated, responsible, eager for change and willing to spend what money they have when presented with well-designed products that help them learn, earn, save, and stay safe. By positioning their products and services correctly and forging the right public-private partnerships, businesses can tap into this underserved market, unleashing a world of good (and good business) in the process. 
WHY HUMAN-CENTRED DESIGN? Human Centred-Design (HCD) is the process of gaining a deep understanding of people to design new solutions. It’s based on the belief that creating stuff that people want is the first rule to creating stuff at all. We believe all of the users of a system are important to design for: not just the end users of a product or service, but all the people who interact with a business. 
SPRING was designed not just by understanding girls and their needs, but businesses and their needs— their ecosystems (including governments, partnerships and employees) and their end users. In addition, we not only understand the needs of our participants by researching with them, we go a step further and design our curriculum with them.

FCC chairman Tom Wheeler is recommending that the agency approve Charter Communications ’ $67 billion deal to acquire Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, expanding its footprint into key markets like Los Angeles and New York. 
“As proposed, the order outlines a number of conditions in place for seven years that will directly benefit consumers by bringing and protecting competition to the video marketplace and increasing broadband deployment.” Wheeler said in a statement on Monday. “If the conditions are approved by my colleagues, an additional two million customer locations will have access to a high-speed connection. At least one million of those connections will be in competition with another high-speed broadband provider in the market served, bringing innovation and new choices for consumers, and demonstrate the viability of one broadband provider overbuilding another.” 
The almost certain green light from the FCC comes almost a year after federal regulators rejected Comcast’s effort to acquire Time Warner Cable, a combination of the No. 1 and No. 2 cable providers. 
By contrast, Charter’s acquisitions create the third largest video provider, with 17.3 million subscribers, and the second largest broadband provider, with 19.4 million subscribers. 
The merger still must get clearance from California’s Public Utilities Commission. A final decision is expected by May 12. 
As with the proposed Comcast deal, a concern among regulators was what impact the Charter transaction would have on the growth of streaming video. Services like Netflix and Apple TV depend on Charter’s broadband delivery for their services, yet Charter also competes with them in its offering of cable packages. 
There was speculation that one of the mergers conditions would be that Charter engage in fair treatment of streaming services. A concern has been contract provisions that restrict content providers from offering programming to rivals. 
Dish Network lined up with other companies and public interest groups to oppose the combination or raise serious concerns, arguing that the combination would create a Comcast-Charter duopoly. Time Warner also raised concerns over the impact on its streaming services, like HBO Now. 
But Charter all but committed to a series of conditions as it first sought the FCC’s approval, including a pledge not to impose data caps or usage based pricing. It also said that it would upgrade its broadband network to higher speeds, and engage in “reasonable and nondiscriminatory” interconnection practices, and submit any disputes to the FCC on a case-by-case basis. 
Netflix, which opposed the Comcast-TW Cable merger, supported this one. 
Interconnection had been a flashpoint between Netflix and Comcast as Comcast sought regulatory approval of the Time Warner Cable merger. Netflix argued that Comcast would gain too much power as it was able to demand fees to content providers for connecting to its network and to subscribers’ homes. Filed Under:

“Global warming is the biggest scam in history. I am amazed, appalled and highly offended by it.” Longtime meteorologist and Weather Channel founder John Coleman 
With last Friday’s Earth Day marked by the US among 170 nations out of the planet’s 190 nations signing last December’s UN Paris climate change agreement at the United Nations, the topic “global warming/climate change” is once again all abuzz these days. Additionally, in less than a week a documentary entitled “The Climate Hustle” is being released in movie theaters nationwide on May 2 nd debunking the notion that humans have caused global warming from the alleged increased CO2 greenhouse effect. This new film arrives as the answered rebuttal exactly a decade after ex-VP Al Gore’s Oscar-winning “Inconvenient Truth” pushed the global warming agenda to unprecedented heights. Gore was rewarded with a Nobel Peace Prize for his propagandist sci-fi movie. Recall his “true planetary emergency” calling for “drastic measures” to reduce the greenhouse gases before “reaching the point of no return” within ten years. Well, his ten years have come and gone and for all his over-predicting of end-of-the-world crises due to global warming, Gore and his alarmist minions have virtually no evidence of any warming to show for all their doom and gloom catastrophic warnings. 
That said, the global warming industry stakes are now worth an annual $1.5 trillion . Yet despite the global elites adapting a climate change agreement, a vast array of critics are blasting their Paris climate accord as merely a $100 billion boondoggle lacking any specific strategies or methods for reducing CO2 levels nor any mandated authority to enforce recommendations hinging on voluntary participation from all nations. Even the father of the global warming movement former NASA climatologist and green activist James Hanson trashes the Paris agreement : 
It’s just bullshit for them to say ‘we’ll have a 2 C. warming target and then try to do a little better every five years.’ It’s worthless words. There is no actions, just promises. As long as fossil fuels appear to be the cheapest fuels out there, they will be continued to be burned. 
The earth’s global warming that Al Gore and his movement attribute to humans burning fossil fuels over the last century has absolutely nothing to do with the global warming presently being observed on every planet in our solar system. Scientists are blaming it on solar warming and the sun’s electromagnetic field is becoming more intense. The fact that solar warming is heating up all the planets strongly suggests that global warming on our planet is not being caused by human activity at all. 
Few skeptical scientists on global warming deny that human-generated CO2 does not warm the planet. But the amount of heating caused by CO2 and other greenhouse gases has never been scientifically determined and is believed to be minuscule. In contrast, in recent years virtually all of Al Gore’s contentions have been refuted and debunked by actual science. Bill Clinton’s Vice President while campaigning for president claimed that he “created the internet” and of course we all know he conveniently stretched the truth on that one. As a lifelong politician raised by another lifelong politician father, his trademark is bending the truth any time he feels the need to impress his audience. Though Al Gore likes to pass himself off as an altruist out to save the world, as a partner in Kleiner Perkins, a venture capital firm that invested a billion dollars in 40 different companies, Gore and his partners stand to hugely profit from cap and trade laws that would make him the first carbon billionaire . 
Back in 2008 Al Gore made the bold prediction that all the ice in the Arctic Sea would be completely melted by 2013-2015 . It clearly hasn’t. The polar icecap has actually grown thicker in 2015 than it was in 2008. Meanwhile, the climate and ice pack on Antarctica is consistently growing thicker and colder at record levels. These polar discrepancies stand in direct contradiction to the global warming alarmist’s original statements as literally the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how Gore’s dire warnings never quite materialize. Hence, in recent years Gore’s political camp quietly and seamlessly renamed their all-important cause from global warming which was disproven to a more benign, less disprovable assertion called climate change. 
One of Gore’s “facts” that acts as his basic premise behind his entire theory is the notion that rising CO2 levels cause global warming. This is not true. What scientists do know is for millions of years the earth has taken turns cyclically shifting back and forth between relative short warming periods compared to longer cooling periods. During the last 800 years of a typical 5,000-year ice age, it’s been determined that temperatures rose before CO2 levels did. This lagging anomaly is a scientific fact that disproves climate change contenders’ central tenet that increasing CO2 levels always cause higher temps. 
Many scientists maintain that increasing CO2 levels only help to stimulate plant growth since the plant kingdom’s fuel are carbon dioxide. 
The clichéd quote so often heard by the alarmists claiming a consensus of 97% of all climate scientists maintain that manmade CO2 levels are causing global warming has also been proven wrong. A closer examination has demonstrated that an extremely minute number of research studies wholeheartedly embrace global warming as fact and that the zealot counting the supposed 12,000 abstracts subjectively misclassified the vast majority as being pro-global warming, in fact, doctoring the results. 
On the other hand, 31,487 scientists (over 9,000 with Ph.D.’s) signed a petition confirming that they do not believe that anthropomorphic (human causing) generated CO2 is a valid concern causing any global warming danger. Yet the lies spewing forth from politicized pseudo-science dogma passed all around the world by MSM presstitutes will never admit it. 
Falsely inflated high-temperature measurements from urban concrete heat zones in numerous research studies supporting the global warming hoax account for up to 3 degree Celsius difference from readings in rural areas. A couple of favorites used by deceitful alarmists in their desperate PR ploys have pulled on public heartstrings promoting polar bear extinction or dying bleached coral reefs as fearmongering threats. 
Early environmentalist scientists spearheaded by founder of the UN Environmental Programme and Canadian billionaire globalist Maurice Strong throughout the 1960’s and 70’s went shopping for research funding that would produce their magic bullet linking CO2 emissions to a disastrous climatic future. In his zealous quest Strong disclosed: 
Isn’t the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse? Isn’t it our responsibility to bring that about? 
Now you can see how the recent globalist manufactured migration crisis and the Paris climate accord committing $100 billion to “fighting CO2” fits right in with Strong’s mission with billions in carbon tax used to codify world governance laws. In 1993 an even more glaring admission to misuse global warming to further advance the New World Order agenda was explicitly declared by the Club of Rome , an elitist think tank comprised of scientists, economists, business and political leaders that often serve as UN consultants of which Maurice Strong himself was a onetime member: 
In searching for a new enemy to unite us , we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming , water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill….All these dangers are caused by human intervention… and thus the real enemy, then, is humanity itself … believe humanity requires a common motivation, namely a common adversary in order to realize world government . It does not matter if this common enemy is a real one or… one invented for the purpose. 
Thus the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was born, opportunistically latching onto the highly bogus 1998 MBH98 study that included grossly flawed methodology as its smoking gun “proving” global warming with the infamous “hockey stick” CO2 spike pattern used by Al Gore in his acclaimed disinfo propaganda flick. Later researchers debunked the MBH98 findings identifying errors that when corrected to include missing 15 th century data showed even higher temperatures than today minus of course any manmade cause back then, thus shattering the myth of human carbon dioxide emissions causing a warmer earth. Additionally, for two straight decades now, satellite derived data records show no statistically significant global warming trend at all. Even surface readings over the last decade have failed to deliver the bad news globalists like Gore were literally banking on. So by default, let’s call it climate change and keep hammering away with more lies until they become accepted science dogma. 
The often heard climate change narrative readily cites increasing number of hurricanes and tornadoes as the sought after proof that climate change is real. Yet once again reality fails to back up the claims. For the fourth year in a row, tornadoes fell under the average with 2015 one of the lowest years on record . And regarding killer hurricanes, the US is in the longest drought in its recorded history since records began in 1851. The last category 3 hurricane was Wilma that struck Florida over a decade ago. Furthermore, a University of Colorado study released results last year stressing the need for caution in interpreting extreme weather, warning not to succumb to an obvious temptation to attribute every extreme weather event to global warming. The study concluded that no statistical evidence supports a rise in extreme weather caused directly by global warming or climate change. 
In the case of the spike in major earthquakes and active volcanoes ( 40 now ) this year, solar activity , 11-year sun cycles and increased risk of comets and asteroids heading towards the earth are more commonly linked to a potential causal explanation than climate change or global warming. The presence of profound earth changes appear to be occurring on a global scale, but again these changes may well be part of a larger stellar phenomenon unfolding within our solar system and not due at all to anthropomorphic CO2 levels. 
Still another controversial and rarely if ever mentioned the factor that is impacting climate and weather events is the widespread geoengineering “chemtrails” that have for decades now been artificially blanketing and poisoning the skies and life on the ground. Chemtrails are likely causing the drought in California. Spraying chemicals have become so pronounced in recent years throughout North America and Europe that in places it has seemingly permanently altered the skyline coloring it a dull whitish grey. A number of heavy toxic metals falling to the ground have been detected including aluminum, barium, strontium , sulfur, all are harmful to human health far more than CO2 emissions. Yet their destruction and increasingly health hazard to animals, humans as well as vegetation (especially scorched trees) intentionally at hidden taxpayer expense is covertly been perpetrated by US and other Western governments. 
Temperatures measured at both ground level and lower atmospheric levels are affected by a myriad of factors . Yet the UN agreement and the widespread political dogma masquerading as science that climate change/global warming is indisputably caused by the rise in manmade CO2 levels blindly denies all the other scientifically known factors that influence the planet’s temperatures rendering them all inconsequential. This is totally misleading and downright false. Prevailing global winds, cloud cover, orbital earth changes in tilting of axis, ocean cycles that include growth of microscopic creatures, water vapor, methane gas, volcanic activity, the solar system and the sun all are scientifically-established co-determinants in varying global temps and climate change. It’s an extremely complex interplay of dozens of co-occurring variables that cause climate. Over simplistic analyses based on computer model algorithms insisting that man’s CO2 gases are heating up the planet has been coalesced and co-opted into a unifying political agenda pushed by environmental extremism, the Democratic Party and ultimately globalism and its world governance to use global warming as its prime mover and shaker to bring about the long plotted one world government tyranny. 
The bottom line reality to virtually everything today is driven by money, power and control. The climate change issue is no different as it has been politicized to where scientific research funding is predicated on only one thing, producing results that the government desires and demands… be it in the US or research sponsored by the UN’s IPCC. Thus, only researchers that produce the numbers supporting the contention that CO2 is causing rising temps get funded. Honest researching scientists who dare investigate the inconvenient truth simply don’t get financed. And only the pro-global warming scientists are given a credible voice to disseminate their findings through respected journals and mainstream media outlets. Like 9/11 truth-ers and vaccine non-believers, dissenting scientists not bought and paid for by big oil or big government, are typically denigrated and dismissed as fringe conspiracy nuts and crackpots. A global warming skeptic is subject to ridicule, career and reputation assault and harassment threatened with RICO litigation. In other words, science just like mainstream media has become so polluted and prostituted by today’s rampant corruption that it no longer is guided by legitimate scientific inquiry and ethically driven investigation for empirical truth… much like Monsanto and Big Pharma control the FDA and EPA to approve harmful drugs without adequate research trials and/or look the other way with egregious earth degradation and pollution. 
But then this is the regressive, Orwellian dark age we’re now living in when dissenting free speech has systematically become criminalized, when our soldiers sent by our government into harm’s way putting their lives on the line come home only to be targeted as the feds’ number one enemy – even more so than the ISIS terrorists the treasonous neocons secretly created and continue supporting, and the mob rule mentality of political correctness that now both trumps and tramples on the constitutional First Amendment. Free intellectual discourse on college campuses has been militantly usurped by angry PC police Nazis acting blindly on emotion to demonize and silence those who dare disagree. If anyone on the planet’s feelings are hurt, PC laws prohibiting free speech are being busily erected to put people exercising their criminalized free speech in jail, be they critics of Islam or so called climate change “deniers.” 
The crime cabal government is now an oligarchic fascist totalitarian police state ushering in yet another reign of terror era where truth itself becomes deep state’s enemy. The elite’s covert agenda to misuse and debase the educational system and mass media through pervasive social engineering and mind control designed to diabolically dumb down and brainwash multiple generations into robotically operating completely devoid of any capacity for critical thinking and reasoning, absolutely clueless in discerning truth from 24/7 lies, disinformation and propaganda has been a resounding success. That said, more citizens of the world every single day are ultimately realizing that their own government as the elite’s authoritarian thugs is their true enemy merely carrying out eugenics marching orders amounting to human genocide. Like the sacrificial lambs of the 3000 Americans murdered by the ruling elite on 9/11, we are all targets for extermination, all but a half billion slaves left alive to service the psychopaths in charge.

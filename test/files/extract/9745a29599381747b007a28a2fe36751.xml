eLOTTERY Inc. Announces Patent Award Allowing Location And Age Verification For Mobile U.S. Lottery Play February 11 Tweet 
STAMFORD, Conn. , Feb. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ eLOTTERY Inc., a leading provider of web-based retailing and e-commerce marketing services to state and governmental lotteries, announced that it has been awarded a patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &quot;This will enable us to offer the industry&apos;s most comprehensive e-commerce solution for the sale of state and governmental lottery products,&quot; said Edwin McGuinn , Chairman and CEO of eLOT, Inc., the parent company of eLOTTERY Inc. 
Prior to today&apos;s patent award, eLOTTERY held eleven U.S. patents covering the sale of lottery tickets over the Internet and other electronic methods via computer terminals communicating with a state&apos;s existing lottery ticket system. 
&quot;With the award of this patent (USPTO #9,230,399), we are now able to offer a compliant online ticket sales system that identifies location, verifies age and player identity via mobile devices,&quot; McGuinn said. 
&quot;This latest intellectual property acquisition will be integrated with our earlier patent awards (USPTO #8,272,959 &amp; 8,678,920) covering the sale of lottery products able to be sold via the Internet or other electronic systems such as mobile devices, kiosks and other remote terminals. 
&quot;These patents allow us to capitalize on what is an enormous and rapidly expanding e-commerce opportunity. In addition, the ability of these patented technologies to record player identification and age/location verification extends to other games of chance played on desktop and mobile devices, such as Powerball, MegaMillions, e-Scratch games, Keno and daily &apos;Fantasy Sports&apos; Games,&quot; McGuinn added. 
According to McGuinn, eLOTTERY calculates that the ability to sell lottery tickets online means virtually every state lottery could increase its sales by as much as 15 percent or on a nationwide industry basis a gross increase of $10 billion to the existing $67 billion of annual U.S. Lottery sales. 
About eLOT, Inc. The company is an application service provider of Internet marketing and e-commerce technology for lotteries and now holds 12 issued U.S. patents and several pending patent applications covering electronic and Internet lottery technology. In addition, eLOT has been issued e-commerce patents for selling state and governmental lottery tickets in Australia , Canada , China and Norway , plus similar patents pending in other countries.

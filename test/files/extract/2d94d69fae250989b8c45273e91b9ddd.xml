The latest Suicide Squad trailer recreated in Fallout 4 The recreation trend continues. Text: Magnus Groth-Andersen Published the 25th of Apr 2016 at 19 
Recreating something inside something else has become a bit of a trend, and now the turn has come to the latest trailer for the upcoming DC Comics movie, Suicide Squad. It&apos;s been recreated by UpIsNotJump using a wide variety of mods, and you can of course the entire thing right here . 
It&apos;s not as impressive as the real trailer, but if you like looking at other media through Bethesda&apos;s game engine, well, there you go, and clearly the amount of work it took is impressive... This is an ad:

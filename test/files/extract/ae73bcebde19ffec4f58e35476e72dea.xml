Powerful features include the new &quot;always connected&quot; Tableau Desktop, improved global map coverage, faster ways to prepare data for analysis, more governance features and easier administration and direct connectivity to the Snowflake Elastic Data Warehouse.
&quot;We have prioritized sharing and collaboration in Tableau 9.3, and it will be immediately noticeable once people open Tableau Desktop,&quot; said Chris Stolte , Chief Development Officer and co-founder of Tableau Software. &quot;The &apos;always connected&apos; feature means it&apos;s easier to share while staying in the flow of your analysis. We&apos;ve also addressed customer requests to advance our global map coverage and to make data prep easier, as well as made improvements across Tableau that create a more delightful experience for everyone.&quot;
Global map coverage is significantly improved in Tableau 9.3. New data is being added to Tableau 9.3 Geocoding Database and Tableau Map Service. More than 250,000 new data points include:
Post code additions for 39 European countries, Belgium , Italy , Netherlands , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland and more India districts USA demographic data layers for 2016 USA ZIP Code updates for 2016 Post code updates to UK, France and Germany Other new features and enhancements in Tableau 9.3 include:

Brierley Hill motorist Alan Holloway spared jail after fatal crash which killed Dudley nurse Christian &apos;Hugh&apos; Davies Share: 0 comments 
A BRIERLEY Hill driver who killed a &quot;much-loved&quot; Dudley nurse when he ploughed into his motorcycle because he failed to see him approaching has been spared jail. 
Christian Davies was on his way to start his shift at Russells Hall Hospital when Alan Holloway drove into his path and he was thrown from his machine. 
It was an &quot;awful&quot; accident that had devastating consequences for family and friends of the 50-year-old staff nurse known as Hugh - Judge John Wait said at Wolverhampton Crown Court. 
He told electrical engineer Mr Holloway: &quot;He lost his life because you turned across the road on which you were travelling. It was a bad mistake that had the most appalling consequences.&quot; 
The Judge added: &quot;For reasons we are unable to understand you missed the vehicles coming up the main dual carriageway and you turned across.&quot; 
Holloway, of Adelaide Street, Brierley Hill, was driving home from work and he had a clear view of the conditions on Pedmore Road when he tried to cross the dual carriageway. 
There was no suggestion he or Mr Davies were speeding, the court was told, and a woman motorist also had to brake hard to avoid crashing into Holloway&apos;s car. 
Howard Searle, prosecuting, told the court Mr Davies, of Martindale Walk, Amblecote, &quot;had no opportunity to brake to avoid the collision and he was killed&quot;. 
Holloway admitted causing death by driving without due care and attention and he was given a five-month jail term suspended for 18 months. 
He was further disqualified from driving for 18 months and ordered to carry out 180 hours unpaid work in the community. 
Afterwards - Mr Davies&apos;s father Elwyn said he felt he had been let down by the Crown Prosecution Service and disappointed at the sentence. 
But Mr Davies (senior), who has also lost two other sons through illness, added: &quot;Nothing will bring him back. The family are devastated and it is something we will never get over. 
&quot;Christian was a dedicated professional at work and he was extremely well liked by everyone. That was proved by 500 people attending his funeral.&quot; 
Mark Davies, the older brother of Christian Davies died in 1997, when he was 34 - and his younger brother Adrian died in 1991 when he was just 22. 
Julie Adams, who had been the partner of Christian Davies for eight years, said in a victim impact statement her life had been shattered by his death. 
She said: &quot;He was my life and my world. Everyday now is just an existence and a struggle.&quot; 
Mr Davies&apos;s daughter Tanaya said going home after the accident had been &quot;emotional torture&quot; and all her dreams and hopes of spending valuable time with her father in the future had been dashed. 
Michael Duck QC, defending, said: &quot;He simply did not see Mr Davies. It was a piece of driving even now he cannot understand or explain.&quot; 
He told the court Holloway, a man of previous good character, was now a broken man. 
He said Holloway had flashes of horror since the accident and he had been &quot;destroyed by what happened&quot;. 
Mr Duck said: &quot;It is not self-pity but the actions of a decent man. He is full of contrition and his remorse is genuine.&quot; Share:

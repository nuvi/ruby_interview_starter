POLICE were called to Caldicot Town AFC’s ground on Friday after reports of a glass being thrown into the crowd. 
Officers attended Jubilee Way following trouble in the Gill Cup final between Caldicot Town and Underwood and reports of disorder broke out between fans. 
An eyewitness told the Argus the glass was thrown and most players from both clubs were chased off the pitch and to a patio area. 
Underwood won the final 2-1 after extra time. 
A Gwent Police spokeswoman said officers were called to Jubilee Way at about 8.55pm. There was no one injured and no one was arrested. Share:

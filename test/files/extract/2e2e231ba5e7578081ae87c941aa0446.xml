Tweet Loss of Al-Mukalla is a blow to the ambitions of the terror group’s Yemen branch Yemeni troops in armoured vehicles and backed by airstrikes advanced toward this city of 500,000 people on Sunday, intending to capture it from militants with al-Qaeda who had controlled the major stronghold for more than a year. Thousands of al-Qaeda fighters were said to be in the city and appeared ready for the battle against the attacking force, which was backed by the UAE. In mosques, the militants asked residents to support them as they confronted “the invaders”. But in the end, hardly a shot was fired. By nightfall, the Qaeda militants had withdrawn from Al-Mukalla in an apparently tactical retreat, residents said. The loss of the city was a blow to the ambitions of al-Qaeda’s Yemeni branch. Over the past year, al-Qaeda had used the city of Al-Mukalla as a base as the militants stormed through southern Yemen, capitalising on the power vacuum caused by the country’s 14-month civil war. In early February, the top counterterrorism official in the Obama administration, Lisa O. Monaco, met Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. A large part of the discussion focused on how to address the threat from the growing Qaeda strongholds in southern Yemen, two U.S. officials said. The UAE has several hundred special operations troops in Yemen, helping to assist the Saudi Arabia-led campaign against the Houthi rebels. With that fighting ebbing for the moment and the warring parties meeting in Kuwait to discuss a possible diplomatic solution, the plan is to shift troops from the UAE to work with many of the 11,000 Yemeni tribal fighters and other Yemeni forces they have trained in the past year to carry out an air and ground assault on al-Qaeda positions in the south.

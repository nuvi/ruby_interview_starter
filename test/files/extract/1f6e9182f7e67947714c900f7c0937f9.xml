Beijing based digital imaging company BlinX to launch their flagship model of action cameras April 25 Share it With Friends The Beijing based digital imaging company, BlinX, today announced that they are on course to launch their flagship model of action cameras later this year BlinX’s range of products are unmatched in the world of action cameras, as they focus on bringing style and elegance into a world of adventure, as confirmed by Anthony Spicer, CMO of BlinX. “BlinX believes that every single person tells a unique story in capturing their life experience, thus our cameras are a symbol of inspiration of this uniqueness. It’s a statement to the world that there is beauty in every action, even in our designs.” Action cams in the market today have been limited in design due to size and weight limitations from peripheral support. In effect, many cams are very similar in appearance, favoring plastic over metal, and have little to offer above features, for uniqueness in design. “As a group of photo and electronics enthusiasts, we devote ourselves in developing new ways to record and share life experiences, with a sense of style and individuality. Our Action Camera models are a result of this devotion, mixed with years of hard work. A clean brushed aluminum finish, crystal clear LCD screens, and soft LED lighting give a sense of beauty and elegance.” stated Mr. Yan Lu, CEO of BlinX. The BlinX range of action cameras which include the upcoming ‘OWL’, a 360° Camera Array, look to be a great addition for enthusiasts that don’t want to go along with mainstream trends, a real choice of individuality for those who enjoy fresh experiences.Let’s look forward to seeing their products, bringing new fashion trends to the action camera market.

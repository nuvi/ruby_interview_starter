Wonder Woman is well on it’s way with filming and they are currently using the beautiful country of Italy. 
Connie Nielse has been spotted on set as Queen Hippolyta riding a horse covered in Amazonian armour. The setting for Themyscira in this film does look stunning and let’s hope they do Wonder Woman’s home proud using the impressive buildings and landscape Italy has to offer. 
Wonder Woman is due out June 2nd 2017

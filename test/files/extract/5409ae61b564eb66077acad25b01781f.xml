Giant sinkhole opens up in city centre - and engineers left stunned to find what is inside Giant sinkhole opens up in city centre - and engineers left stunned to find what is inside A GIANT 20ft deep sinkhole is causing havoc after appearing in a city centre. PUBLISHED: 19:43, Mon, Apr 25, 2016 | UPDATED: 19:57, Mon, Apr 25, 2016 SWNS The giant sinkhole in Sheffield is 15ft deep 
The vast hole first appeared in the middle of a road in Sheffield on Sunday. 
The enormous drop is estimated to be 15ft deep - enough to swallow a black cab. 
Council staff, contractors and engineers rushed to the scene to assess the extent of the damage after the road crumbled away. 
Hutcliffe Wood Road and surrounding streets were forced to be hastily shut, causing a knock-on effect on traffic throughout the area. 
Initially the hole was due to be filled with concrete, but contractors made a startling discovery. 
Workers discovered the probably source of the massive chasm: an old coal mine lies beneath the ground. 
Pensioner Phil Lovell, 87, said: &quot;I&apos;ve lived round here a long time. 
&quot;I used to live down the road and there were two drift mines. SWNS Roads have been closed after the sinkhole appeared on Sunday SWNS Contractors found what could be a coal mine at the bottom SWNS Contractors were originally going to fill it with concrete 
&quot;We used to come on our bikes and we used to go down the opposite one here.&quot; 
He added the drifts were used to mine ganister, which was formerly used to line furnaces in the once booming steel industry. Related videos

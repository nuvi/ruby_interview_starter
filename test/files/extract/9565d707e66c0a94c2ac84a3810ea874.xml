It&apos;s not your typical viral video, but a real-time simulation of the Titanic sinking has millions of views on YouTube  since it was uploaded on April 14.
The video runs a remarkable two hours and 41 minutes. And it&apos;s actually a teaser for an immersive video game currently in production called Titanic: Honor and Glory , which will let players experience what it was like to be on the ill-fated ship when it went down.

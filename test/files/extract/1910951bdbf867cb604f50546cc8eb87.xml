Steven Tyler mourns Prince   
LOS ANGELES, Apr 25: “American Idol” judge Steven Tyler has mourned the sudden demise of musician Prince, calling it a huge loss to music. Prince was mysteriously found dead in the elevator of his Paisley Park home in Minnesota on April 21. Though the exact cause of death remains unknown, there are speculations that drug use may have contributed. Tyler, who has struggled with addiction, says it makes the loss more tragic as it could have been avoided. He hoped that reports that Prince was treated for the misuse of prescription drugs are untrue, reported People magazine.“As a recovering drug addict and alcoholic, I get that. In the 80s I fell to my knees with my addictions,” the musician said.“Doctors are the new pushers. All of America isn’t strung out on street drugs, they’re strung out on prescribed drugs.” But Tyler is hoping that “whoever brought him to the hospital that night will have something to say…I hope it’s not drugs. But if it is, this didn’t have to happen.” The musician said the sudden death of Prince has been a little hard to take.“I’ve certainly had my moments of crying about him. He was a saint. He was a musician and he spoke my language so it’s a little harder to take.” (PTI) Share this:

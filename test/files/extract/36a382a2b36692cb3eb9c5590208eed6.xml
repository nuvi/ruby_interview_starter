Abu Dhabi&apos;s International Petroleum Investment Corp. said on Monday that it will make an overdue interest payment on a 1Malaysia Development Bhd. bond, but only if the troubled Malaysian government investment fund defaults on the debt.
IPIC&apos;s statement, made in a filing to the London Stock Exchange, comes as a five-day grace period for the late payment elapses Monday. IPIC was a guarantor on two $1.75 billion bonds privately issued by 1MDB in 2012.
&quot;As at the time of this announcement, IPIC is not aware of the guarantee being called upon. IPIC has always honored its obligations arising from any agreements it has entered in to and will continue to do so,&quot; it said in the statement. &quot;Accordingly, if a 1MDB Default occurs and IPIC is called upon in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the Guarantee, IPIC will honor its obligations in relation to this interest payment, which shall be met out of IPIC&apos;s existing liquidity.&quot;
In a statement earlier on Monday to The Wall Street Journal, 1MDB&apos;s chief executive, Arul Kanda, said: &quot;we are not currently in a position to add any more than what has already been said.&quot;
IPIC&apos;s statement signals a key turning point in the deteriorating relationship between the one-time allies. IPIC last year ​extended a billion-dollar loan to the scandal-scarred Malaysian fund and agreed to take over interest payments on $3.5 billion in 1MDB debt.​
This month however IPIC accused 1MDB of reneging on ​a ​key term of that agreement and said it wouldn&apos;t make a regular interest payment ​that was ​due on Apr. 18, raising the question of whether 1MDB would default on the bond when a grace period elapsed Monday.
​A widening scandal has enveloped 1MDB, which is under investigation in seven countries, including Malaysia. The Swiss attorney general said he was investigating possible misappropriations of about $4 billion.

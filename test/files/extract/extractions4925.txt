Miami Coast Guard spent 12 hours trying to coax a bungling adventurer out of his homemade inflatable bubble after already warning him not to attempt his &apos;life-threatening&apos; 3,500 mile ocean journey.
Endurance athlete Reza Baluchi, 44, was given a written warning by the Coast Guard not to attempt the five month trip, which they deemed too dangerous, last week.
But Baluchi ignored this and launched his homemade hydro pod bubble from Pompano Beach, Florida on Saturday, bound for Bermuda via the Caribbean.

A day later the adventurer agreed to to be voluntarily rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard.
Baluchi now faces a possible fine of up to $40,000 or jail time of up to seven years for ignoring their letter of warning.
This is the second time the 44-year-old had to be rescued by the Coast Guard in his inflatable, the last time being in October 2014 when he had attempted to journey 3,000 miles from Florida to Bermuda.

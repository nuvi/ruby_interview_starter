Dubai Wants 25 Percent of All Car Trips Driverless by 2030 By The Associated Press DUBAI, United Arab Emirates  Apr 25, 2016, 7:50 AM ET 0 Shares Email Dubai, already home to the world&apos;s tallest building, is looking to get ahead by getting out of the driver&apos;s seat. Dubai&apos;s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , announced plans Monday to have 25 percent of all car trips in this city-state in the United Arab Emirates to be driverless by 2030. In a statement carried by the state-run WAM news agency, Sheikh Mohammed said it would cut down on costs and traffic crashes. He said the project would be a joint venture by Dubai&apos;s Roads and Transport Authority and the Dubai Future Foundation. Already, Dubai is home to a driverless Metro rail system. It also has a number of taxi companies, driven by a large foreign labor force. There was no discussion about what would become of the drivers. 0 Shares

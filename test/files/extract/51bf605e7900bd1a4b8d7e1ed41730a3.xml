Russell man charged with stalking PUBLISHED: MONDAY, APRIL 25, 2016 AT 1:36 PM PREV A A 
RUSSELL — St. Lawrence sheriff’s deputies on Monday charged Rusty D. Gotham, 48, of 22 Backus Road, with misdemeanor third-degree stalking. 
Deputies charge that Mr. Gotham sent 11 anonymous emails from his home on separate occasions — some sexual in nature — to a Canton woman. 
Deputies said the arrest followed a nine-month-long investigation which included the execution of a search warrant at Mr. Gotham’s home on Friday evening after they were able to link Mr. Gotham’s Google email address to his residence. They said Mr. Gotham had used different email accounts when allegedly sending the woman emails. 
Mr. Gotham was arraigned in Canton Town Court by Judge James L. Monroe and was released. 
Department of Homeland Security Investigations Special Agents assisted in the investigation.

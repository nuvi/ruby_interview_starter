Key Senator: House, Senate reach deal on Arizona budget - KVOA | KVOA.com | Tucson, Arizona Member Center: Key Senator: House, Senate reach deal on Arizona budget By BOB CHRISTIEAssociated Press 
PHOENIX (AP) - A key Republican senator says leaders of the Arizona House and Senate have reached an agreement on a state budget plan and he expects legislation to be introduced early this week. 
Senate appropriations committee chairman Don Shooter said Monday morning that he expects the budget package to be formally introduced on Tuesday. 
The agreement comes after a week of daily meetings between Gov. Doug Ducey&apos;s aides and Republican leadership in the House and Senate. 
Shooter declined to give specifics of the agreement. But he says this is the first agreement in his six years in office that the state will be able to boost spending significantly to address major needs in Arizona. He calls that &quot;a magnificent feeling.&quot; 
Details on what&apos;s included in individual budget legislation are still being finalized. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. Search Local Businesses

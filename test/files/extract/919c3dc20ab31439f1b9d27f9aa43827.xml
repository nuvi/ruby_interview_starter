April 25, 2016 Scientists find interaction between amyloid and tau proteins that cause brain damage linked with AD 
Rosa-Neto’s team analyzed the performances of 120 cognitively intact individuals over two years (equal gender distribution; average age 75). By measuring amyloid levels using PET scans and tau proteins through cerebrospinal fluid analysis, the researchers were able to identify the patients at risk of brain damage associated with AD. { read more here }

To say the least, we’re in an interesting time right now. Many would say it’s some of the darkest days. I would suggest that those who think we are in “the darkest” days have not closely studied history. Not only modern American history but many other past historical times could certainly give this time a run for it’s money, so to speak. 
I’ve been doing a good bit of reading on the web – news, commentary, social media – and then today, in my devotions, I read I Samuel 3:10 – when God is talking to Samuel in the night: 
“Then God came and stood before him exactly as before, calling out, “Samuel! Samuel!” 
Samuel answered, “Speak. I’m your servant, ready to listen.” 
And it really struck me. Do we have it all wrong? 
Are we, in these times of turbulence, doing too much speaking? 
Are we too busy talking about those who are offended or those who take offense? 
And not busy enough listening to what God is saying? 
Are we too busy speaking about advancing our own agenda – and not busy enough listening to what God’s agenda is? 
Are we too busy doing what we think we want so we can’t hear when God is speaking? 
Are we too busy speaking about how to make a difference and not busy enough listening to what God says about how to love our neighbors? 
May we all, in this “interesting” time, spend more time listening to God and doing what He says and less time filling up our minds with what modern media and modern politicians say? 
“ Speak. I’m your servant, ready to listen.” 
Notice the fourth word? Servant 
Samuel isn’t saying He’s in charge, he’s acknowledging God’s in charge and he’s willing to do what God says…… 
May it also be said of us that we listened to God and did what He told us.

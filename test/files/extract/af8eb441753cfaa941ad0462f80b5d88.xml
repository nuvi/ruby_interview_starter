- Life in the times of RRS Boaty McBoatface Westminster Gleanings Have William and Kate put the Diana myth to bed with a nicely prosaic image in front of the Taj Mahal? 
The Queen&apos;s 90th birthday has managed to knock questions of Brexit, the Panama papers and the prime minister&apos;s family finances somewhat off the front pages here. Sadly, unforeseen disasters intervene and the terrible earthquakes in Ecuador and Japan remind us that whatever humankind does to itself, nature can usually do worse. The constant elephant-in-the-room of the refugees stuck in hideous limbo on Greek islands and elsewhere has been highlighted by a visit from the pope who has carried off 12 desperate people to the safety of the Vatican. I hope one of them one day writes that story, can you imagine anything more surreal? 
Meanwhile, with relief we allow ourselves a respite to celebrate an extraordinary life of duty lived under constant public scrutiny that has often been far less affectionate than it is now. Have William and Kate meanwhile put the Diana myth to bed with an over-staged but nicely prosaic image of a cheerful young couple sitting on a bench in front of the wondrous Taj Mahal? I don&apos;t know, but that attractive-enough pair happily lack the dangerous glamour of his mother and make the future of monarchy, indeed a future monarch in this country at all, an altogether more plausible prospect than was the case 24 years ago. On balance, that seems a better thing for us at the moment than any alternative although we may all change our minds quickly enough when we eventually lose the remarkable, and remarkably loved, figurehead we have now, still stalwart as she enters her 10th decade. 
The old in the United Kingdom in general may be living longer but are increasingly badly cared for. The National Health Service, another of our great institutions, has been in trouble for years, and things are getting much much worse. Stories from friends of my mother&apos;s generations, lucky as they point out, still to be on the books of a private doctor here or there and still to be able to pay for private care in extremis , are terrifying. Weeks of pills and potions prescribed by NHS surgeries leaving them more and more unwell with a leftover winter ailment until, in despair, they pay up for a private consultation resulting in the correct medicine at the correct expensive strength and recovery in a few days. This is insane, it isn&apos;t even cost effective unless the NHS is just trying to kill the old slowly and quietly, and that must be happening to those who are not so well-off. 
Now the so-called junior doctors, those who are not consultants, are striking. They have been striking on and off for ages in a dispute that has been running for years over better pay and benefits or rather against new contracts that they believe offer them a worse deal than previously. The brightest and the best meanwhile leave the country. Part of the problem appears to be this government&apos;s usual reactive policy. In this case, to the no-news news that more patients die in hospital at weekends than during weekdays and promises that we would have a seven-day NHS. In fact, quite obviously we do have a seven-day service albeit not the one we had when that service was rightly the pride of the country, envied across the world. 
There is still great good in the NHS, but there are huge problems in a vast and unwieldy machine that nobody seems able to sort out. Most recently, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, insisted that he would impose the newest contract on doctors regardless of their opposition, but it now seems he may be unable legally to do so. Meanwhile, the strike fever is rising to the extent that during the next junior doctors&apos; strike scheduled for two days at the end of the month, emergency care, previously maintained, will also be withdrawn. This conjures up images of grand consultants being forced to fulfil junior roles to fill the gaps, a sort of &quot;Carry On, Doctor&quot; situation - if anyone remembers those ancient, strangely British, film comedies. The reality, in this case, might not be very amusing for anyone concerned. 
Sticking, however, to things that are funny in order to avoid discussing the Scottish elections on May 5 until we know the results, or the heating up of the European Union referendum campaign, at the moment mainly Boris Johnson doing what can only be described as a Donald Trump, there are other glimmers of entertainment. Try this for pure bonkers pleasure. There has been an online poll to decide the name of the Natural Environment Research Council&apos;s new polar research ship. It ended last weekend after lobbying by various groups for the names of assorted polar worthies, explorers and adventurers who survived or died in pursuit of some chilly goal or other. 
None of the above made much headway in the poll. Instead a former BBC radio presenter came up with a possible name that fits perhaps with an updated version of the same British humour that produced our comedy writers and performers of the past and carried on into television series like Blackadder and films like Mr Bean. Now we have a huge weight of public opinion behind the Royal Research Ship Boaty McBoatface, to follow in the wake of Captain Scott&apos;s RRS Discovery, the Ernest Shackleton and the James Cook. This is not the first time the public has had a moment of united lunatic humour. A poll by Greenpeace to name a humpback whale in the South Pacific for the serious purpose of personalizing animals in order to stop them being killed went clean off message when the vote was hugely in favour of Mr Splashy Pants. One of the runners up for the NERC ship is &quot;It&apos;s Bloody Cold Here&quot;. I don&apos;t think that quite has the ring of the RRS Boaty McBoatface. The final decision on the name will be announced in due course. I wonder how good a sense of humour the NERC has. 
The London mayoral election is also on May 5. The choice is between a Conservative, anti-European, highly privileged and wealthy Zac Goldsmith, who yet has a knowledgeable eye on the environment and urban issues, and a left-wing pro-European Sadiq Khan, one of eight children who grew up on a council estate and nominated Jeremy Corbyn to the leadership of the Labour party. Tricky one to call. Goldsmith might make a very good mayor, I think we will know what we are going to get, but the anti-Europe stance is rather more than a passing concern and puts Goldsmith outside the pale for the time being with his own government. Khan&apos;s opinions seem alarmingly unfixed, basically one has to assume old-fashioned Labour which don&apos;t even play well with his own party and yet, he says, welcoming London&apos;s billionaires, people like Zac Goldsmith&apos;s non-domiciled late father. That goes worse with social justice campaigners. 
I am in a quandary and very much wish I could say none of the above but a list of some of the alternative parties involved might show why there are few other possible choices when the Liberal Democrat and the Green Party candidate are still at the stage of &quot;Caroline who?&quot;. For the rest, we are very quickly back in lunatic territory and it isn&apos;t funny. I could vote for Lee Harris of the Cannabis is better than Alcohol Party or good old ghastly George Galloway of Respect, he stands everywhere himself because his is a one-man party as is presumably the One Love Party of Ankit Love. There is the Women&apos;s Equality Party, mind you. Maybe that&apos;s the best bet. It isn&apos;t very encouraging one way and another.

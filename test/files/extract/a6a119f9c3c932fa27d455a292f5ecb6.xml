Progress in the U.S. housing market remains uneven as the busiest selling season gets under way. Sales of new homes unexpectedly fell in March for a third straight month to a 511,000 annualized pace, reflecting the weakest rate of demand in the West since July 2014. At the same time, the median sales price decreased 1.8 percent from March 2015 to $288,000.

A Student’s Digital Journey 04.19.2016 LISTENING TO PANDORA IS NOT A ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL EXPERIENCE. AND NEITHER IS GETTING AN EDUCATION. 
Today’s students want to learn, but on their terms. To meet this need, online education has enabled more personalized and accessible degree programs. Whether enrolling for the first time or returning to advance a career, potential students are looking to online courses now more than ever. 
Mobile devices, video-conferencing and online collaboration tools have brought the classroom experience online. Now you can get a quality advanced degree from the comfort of your own flannel PJ’s and fluffy bunny slippers (hey, no judgment!). 
We’re not saying the traditional classroom is going extinct, just that the journey is changing . So your EDU marketing strategy should change too. We’ve done our homework, and online education is going mainstream. 
Reaching potential online students is easy if you go where they are. Every student has a favorite study buddy. And no, we’re not talking about a greasy pepperoni pizza or the cute boy across the library. It’s music. Always. 
By 2019, roughly half of all college classes will be digitally based 1 , so marketers need to be tuned-in to this new generation of students. They are plugged-in, tech savvy and down with personalization. It’s never been more important to partner with publishers that can leverage the passion point of music to deliver impactful messaging to prospective students.

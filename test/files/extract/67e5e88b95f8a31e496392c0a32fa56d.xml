Prince kept a swear box at Paisley Park, friends reveal Prince and former wife Manuela Testolini Credit: Kevork Djansezian/Kevork Djansezian Nick Allen , Minnesota 25 April 2016 • 7:56pm 
P rince kept a swear jar in his multi-million dollar estate which he made visitors and fellow musicians put money in. 
The raunchy pop star was also a dedicated Jehova&apos;s Witness who made anyone using bad language at his Paisley Park mansion in Minnesota pay up to $10 a time. 
&quot;He didn&apos;t want to dishonor the faith. He wasn&apos;t joking,&quot; said friend and fellow Jehova&apos;s Witness James Lundstrom. &quot;You had to pay in cash in the bucket. He would charge you between three and 10 dollars per swear word. Once I bumped my knee and I said &apos;damn&apos;. He said &apos;What did you say?&apos;&quot; 
On one occasion a foul-mouthed back-up singer arrived with a handful of hundred dollar bills and paid in advance, putting the money in the &quot;cuss bucket&quot;. 
Prince became a Jehova&apos;s Witness in 2003 and attended Kingdom Hall, a centre less than half a mile from his home. He was known there as Brother Nelson, his birth surname. 
At a service on Sunday an elder told the congregation: &quot; Our brother Prince fell asleep in death.&quot; 
Fellow believers said he sometimes drank red wine but was otherwise teetotal. 
Bruce McFarland, secretary of the congregation, said Prince was &quot;exceptionally shy&quot; and would attend services regularly with a Bible littered with post-it notes. Prince: his 10 best songs 

A photograph showed him at a Jehova;s Witness conference last summer sitting in the back row of a crowd. 
The singer was found dead aged 57 in a lift at Paisley Park on Thursday. A week earlier his private jet had performed an emergency landing in Illinois after he suffered a non-fatal overdose of prescription painkillers. 
In a recording of the emergency call from the plane the pilot could be heard saying he needed to land and an air traffic controller called for paramedics to meet the flight. Artist pays tribute to Prince with &apos;coffee&apos; painting Play! 01:21 

Prince&apos;s musical collaborator and close friend Sheila E., said there were plans to turn Paisley Park into a museum. 
She said: &quot;We’re hoping to make Paisley what he wanted it to be. He was working on it being a museum. He’s been gathering memorabilia and stuff from all the tours, like my drums and his motorcycle.&quot; 
There will also be a tribute concert, she said. &quot;I’m supposed to be the one musical director to put his tribute together with all of the original people and we hope that that happens. We’re working on it, we’ll see what happens. The plan is to have something here in Minneapolis.” 
She said 20 people attended a memorial at Paisley Park, listening to his songs. She said: &quot;I had his urn in my hand, it was unreal. Some of those songs were hard to listen to. I just started crying uncontrollably. There was not a lot of talking. You grabbed on to someone, hugged them and cried.&quot; 
Denying that Prince was addicted to painkillers she said: “I’ve never seen him take anything not even aspirin in the 38 years I’ve known him. Was he in pain? Yeah he was in pain.&quot;

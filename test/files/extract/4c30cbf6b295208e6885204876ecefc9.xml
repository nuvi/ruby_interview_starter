About Scorpio
Launched in June 2002,Scorpio was a great leap forward for the Indian automobile industry. Equipped with a powerful engine and modern car-like features, exuding a macho style and a bold attitude, Scorpio redefined the SUV space and, in a broader sense, transformed the unglamorous utility vehicle into something more aspirational.
Over the years Scorpio has emerged as a trendsetter as far as technology is concerned with many firsts to its name including the innovative Voice Messaging System, Micro Hybrid (start/stop) technology, 6-speed Automatic Transmission (the only SUV in its class with automatic transmission) and being India’s first BS4-emission compliant vehicle.
Scorpio’s victories in some of the world’s toughest rallies coupled with success in multiple domestic and international expeditions, under the banner of Mahindra Adventure, go a long way in reinforcing its tough and rugged DNA. It is no surprise then that Scorpio has found favour not only with the Armed Forces but also with police, para-military and security forces across the country.
Admiration and loyalty for the brand is evident not only from sales numbers – with annual sales of over 50,000 units for 4 years in a row – but from the more than 3.2 million fans on Facebook - making it the largest SUV Facebook community in India. The magic of the Scorpio is further seen in the array of impromptu fan clubs initiated by customers in the virtual and real world and in over 12 million views on its YouTube channel.

Sort Nike Nike , originally known as Blue Ribbon Sports, was founded by Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman in January of 1964. It became Nike in 1972 when a new model soccer shoe came about which was simply named the Nike . Fast forward almost half a centry and we are still proud to be an official Nike stockist curating a vast and wide selection of Nike classics to our faithful Leeds patrons.

Hank Osowski, managing director of Strategic Health Group , will deliver the keynote address at the &quot;Integrated Behavioral Health&quot; conference April 26-27 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Sponsored by the Healthcare Education Associates (HEA), the conference will focus on &quot;whole-person care models for health plans and providers,&quot; with Osowski&apos;s remarks looking at how an integrated care approach can end the fragmentation that currently exists between behavioral health and physical health. 
&quot;Sadly there remains a stigma with mental health; and many individuals feel nervous, embarrassed or even ashamed to see a mental health specialist,&quot; says Osowski. &quot;Compounding the problem is that there are simply not enough physicians and other practitioners trained and prepared to recognize and treat behavioral health issues. This has to change. It is critically important from both a societal and financial perspective that we learn to identify all of a patient&apos;s healthcare needs regardless of why or through which door he or she entered the healthcare system.&quot; 
Historically carved out in insurance coverage, payers and providers are increasingly seeing behavioral health as a major opportunity to leverage new models of whole-person care in order to reduce avoidable and costly re-admissions. With that foundation Osowski&apos;s timely presentation will focus on the central themes and challenges of integrating medical and behavioral health, discuss models of success nationwide, and outline the significant cost savings that can be achieved through effective integration. 
A frequent speaker and author on critical issues facing the healthcare industry, Osowski has provided strategic leadership to healthcare systems as well as commercial, Medicare and Medicaid health plans for more than three decades. Prior to co-founding Strategic Health Group in 2011 with partner Dennis Eder, Osowski served as senior vice president of corporate development for SCAN Health Plan, one of the nation&apos;s largest not-for-profit Medicare Advantage plans. Osowski has also served as a member of the senior management team at Blue Cross of California and as a principal in a national healthcare consulting organization providing a range of strategic, financial and development services for health plans, physician groups and hospitals. 
Since 2005 HEA has provided the healthcare industry with educational and networking opportunities covering issues and topics that are influencing the course of healthcare. As a result, HEA has established itself as the leading provider of substantive, topical information for C-suite healthcare executives. 
Strategic Health Group provides healthcare organizations with consulting services across a wide spectrum of needs including strategic planning, market expansion, corporate finance and treasury, marketing communications, actuarial services and many others. SHG is also available to help organizations with mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, financial and operational turnarounds, interim executive management, and business planning and budgeting.

ANN ARBOR, Mich. , April 25, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- DTE Energy is joining the LPGA Volvik Championship as an official sponsor and proud supporter of Military Appreciation events throughout the Memorial Day tournament week ( May 23-29 ). The tournament, a new addition to the 2016 LPGA tour, will be held at Travis Pointe Country Club in Ann Arbor . 
The DTE Energy sponsorship allows retired and active United States military personnel plus a guest free admission to the tournament. DTE will provide lunch at the Military Appreciation Pavilion, located at the course&apos;s ninth green. Information about careers in the energy industry and employment opportunities at DTE Energy also will be available in the pavilion. 
In addition to the support provided for the U.S. Military at the tournament, DTE Energy will work with the LPGA Volvik Championship charity partner -- the National Network of Depression Centers (NNDC) -- to help promote the work of its Military, Veterans and Families Task Group, and the Military Support Programs and Network (MSPAN), based out of the University of Michigan . 
&quot;DTE Energy is privileged, during this Memorial Day weekend, to honor those who have so bravely served our country. We hope to provide our active and retired U.S. military personnel an opportunity to attend the tournament and, most importantly, to support military families through our partnership with the National Network of Depression Centers,&quot; said Diane Antishin , DTE Energy vice president, Human Resources. &quot;We are committed to providing employment opportunities for veterans because we recognize the value that their skills, knowledge and experience bring to the work place. We&apos;re excited about the opportunity to give something back to those who have given us all so much.&quot; 
The National Network of Depression Centers is a consortium of more than 600 experts working collaboratively to conquer mood disorders. NNDC members are leading efforts to advance diagnoses and treatments, and improve patient outcomes and quality of care for those with bipolar, depressive and related mental illnesses. These disorders are costly, disabling, and frighteningly common, impacting just one in every six Americans by recent estimates. NNDC Members have a special commitment to aid the mental health of our dedicated military members, veterans, and military families. 
&quot;We recognize that members of the military, veterans, and their families face unique stressors that magnify the impact of depression and related mood disorders,&quot; said Dr. John Greden , Founding Chair of the NNDC and Executive Director of the University of Michigan Comprehensive Depression Center. &quot;We are continuing to identify and develop the best ways to address the needs of service members, and we are glad to have DTE Energy and the Volvik Championship joins us on these efforts.&quot; 
The innovative M-SPAN programs are part of a University-Military-VA-Community partnership that provides pre- and post-deployment support for military, veterans, and their families. Through programs like Buddy-to-Buddy and Peer Advisors for Veteran Education (PAVE), service members and veterans work directly with other veterans who can speak personally to the unique military mental health experience. 
&quot;We want to provide our community with an event that brings the greatest women golfers in the world to Southeast Michigan throughout the Memorial Day weekend,&quot; said Keith Karbo , tournament director for the LPGA Volvik Championship. &quot;We also want to show appreciation for our military and help create awareness for our nation&apos;s service personnel and their families through the work of NNDC and M-SPAN. DTE Energy&apos;s commitment provides the impetus to help create the needed awareness.&quot;

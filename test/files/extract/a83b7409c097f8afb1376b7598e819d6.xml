It was great to be back at the Tackley Horse Show this year for this lovely equestrian event. Due to staff illness, we were unable to deploy our full team – apologies to those that had to wait to view their photos. 
All of the pictures from the event are now online in our gallery. Those that bought pictures from us on the day will find a complimentary copy has been added to our Facebook page so don’t forget to tag yourself!

I’m fond of saying that in my profession a teacher does more than instruct their subject. 
Teachers help young people become human beings — humane, thoughtful and curious individuals with integrity who will make the world a better place in ways either humble or extraordinary. 
That means that, even though I am a history teacher, I don’t care if my students remember five years from now why Martin Van Buren failed re-election. (The domestic economic crisis known as The Panic of 1837 and its subsequent depression is the main reason, if you must know.) 
One of the things I do care about is that they are a better person. 
Several of my high school teachers did the same for me and one of their tools was advice. 
Yeah, I know: Offering advice to teen-agers is sometimes like trying to teach a pig to dance. It frustrates the teacher and annoys the pig. 
But the classroom is the greatest bully pulpit in the world and there are all kinds of opportunities to have influence. Here’s some advice that I received in high school, advice that I still give my students when they are willing — or even not so willing — to listen: 
• Don’t dumb yourself down: Sometimes bright, talented and skilled people are afraid to show what they are made of. They often learn in life that their gifts intimidate others or make them the object of jealousy. I say let your light shine brightly. However, also know the corollary to Advice No. 1: A little humility goes a long way. Don’t forget that no matter how intelligent or talented you are, someone helped you get to where you are and someone else will help you go even further. 
• Hold your heroes to high standards: So many people will disappoint us in life. It is an unfortunate part of the human experience. Yet, young people have individuals they admire for very good reasons. I urge my students to expect the best from those people because they are role models. Don’t expect perfection, but do expect him or her to live up to the values you admire in them. When a role model makes a mistake, learn from it. Corollary to Advice No. 2: Sometimes in life we learn what not to do, even from our heroes. 
• It’s never too late for an apology: Best. Advice. Ever — particularly for a young man like me who in his youth often shot his mouth off without considering the consequences. (I’m sure there are plenty of people who can point out how I practice that bad habit still.) I tell my students that they might need to eat humble pie (a quaint term that sometimes requires explanation) but that’s better than being a jerk. Corollary to Advice No. 3: When in doubt, apologize. If you think you are in the wrong, it can’t hurt. It might help. 
• You might need to suck it up from time to time: Life is tough and young people need to learn how to cope so they can have long lives with the best chance for happiness. Harsh advice? I say “no.” Even students who face physical, intellectual or emotional challenges need to discover how they can deal with problems, set-backs and disappointments. I know too many parents whose answer is “make things easier.” Fortunately, I find that many students are receptive to the idea that they have to try a little harder, or exercise a little more patience, or finish what they started. Corollary to Advice No. 4: Seeking help is not a sign of weakness. I suggest the best help is the kind that allows a student to face the problem, solve the problem, and move on without enabling the student. 
Critics will say that my list joins thousands of other lists of inane advice suitable for long-winded and forgettable graduation speeches. 
Perhaps. All I can say is teachers who cared offered this advice to me and, because I was willing to listen and act on the advice, it changed my life for the better. 
I don’t claim to possess the wisdom of Socrates, Christ or the Gautama, but I am grateful to Mr. MacDonald (my honors history teacher), Mr. Muradian (my honors English teacher) and Coach Neurian (the man who had me run my legs off) for passing their wisdom on to me. I hope I can do the same for the wonderful young people I help educate.

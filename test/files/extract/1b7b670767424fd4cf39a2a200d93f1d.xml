On July 20, 1969, an American rocket called the Saturn V launched Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin into space in a mission that would end with the first human steps on the moon. To this day, no other rocket has launched human beings as far, or eclipsed the Saturn V’s colossal size.

The answer is mind-boggling, and makes it the most fuel-hungry rocket ever launched into space. With that in mind, YouTube user Maxim Sachs created an awesome animated video to give it some context using Asian elephants, one of the most massive land dwelling creatures on the planet.

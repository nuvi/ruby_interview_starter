Horry County Police chief retires as investigation continues Posted: Updated: 
CONWAY, S.C. (AP) - Horry County Police Chief Saundra Rhodes is retiring in less than two weeks. 
Rhodes made the announcement Monday in a letter to county officials. 
Rhodes became the first African-American and the first woman to lead the agency in 2012. She had spent two decades with the force, working her way through the ranks as detective. 
Rhodes&apos; letter gave no reason for her retirement effective May 6, and she wrote she was looking forward to new challenges. 
The Sun News of Myrtle Beach reports ( http://bit.ly/1SuG4Oq ) that the State Law Enforcement Division is investigating officers in the Horry County Police Department. The agency faces lawsuits over possible sexual harassment by an officer of a rape victim and failing to investigate a rape allegation for nearly three years.

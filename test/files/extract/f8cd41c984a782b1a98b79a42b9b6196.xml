Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he is outraged to hear that Canadian hostage John Ridsdel has been killed by terrorists in the Philippines, and is vowing to hunt down those responsible. 
“This was an act of cold-blooded murder and responsibility rests solely with the terrorist group that took him hostage,” the prime minister said during a brief press conference in Alberta on Monday. 
Trudeau said the safety of Canadians is a top priority and vowed to work with the Philippines and other allies “to pursue those responsible for this heinous act.” 
The prime minister offered his condolences to the family and friends of Ridsdel. 
He did not take questions, saying that commenting further could “compromise ongoing efforts or endanger the safety of the remaining hostages.” 
Ridsdel, 68, and fellow Canadian Robert Hall were among four hostages who were abducted from an upscale resort complex on a southern Philippine island in September by Abu Sayyaf militants. 
Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad and Filipino Marites Flor were also among the hostages. 
On April 15, a video emerged of Ridsdel and Hall appealing to the Canadian government to pay their ransom. In the video, the two warned that they would be beheaded if the ransom was not paid by 3 p.m. Monday. 
The captors were demanding 300 million pesos, or about CAD $8 million, for each hostage. 
On Monday, Philippine officials confirmed that the head of a Caucasian man was recovered in the southern Philippines. 
Local police said the severed head was found in a plastic bag along a street in Jolo, a town in Sulu province. 
Interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose issued a statement Monday calling Ridsdel’s killing “shocking and saddening” and offering her condolences to his loved ones. 
“Incidents like this should remind all of us that the threat of terrorism remains very real,” the statement went on. “We must stand with our allies in solidarity against terrorism, which remains the greatest challenge that the world faces today.”

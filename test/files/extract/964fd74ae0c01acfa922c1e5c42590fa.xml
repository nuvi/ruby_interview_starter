___ 
11:20 a.m. 
As President Barack Obama tours the Hannover trade fair, hundreds of people are demonstrating outside against job cuts at the American technology and consulting company IBM. 
Some 200 IBM workers staged a noisy rally on the edge of the fairground Monday to protest against the measures they say will cost 900 jobs in Germany. 
Demonstrators held up placards reading &quot;Profit, profit, profit, where&apos;s the human?&quot; and &quot;We are family? One IBM. Find the mistake.&quot; 
A union leader called on protesters to &quot;be loud — maybe the president will hear you.&quot; Obama is in Hannover to promote American business at the world&apos;s largest industrial trade fair.

9:45 a.m. 
President Barack Obama is something of a technology geek and he is in his element at the Hannover Messe. 
Obama and his host, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, are checking out high-tech inventions and chatting with developers at the massive industrial technology trade show. 
The leaders are learning about minicomputers that send data from a car to the cloud, a sensor that mimics a gecko&apos;s feet to pick up objects and ultra-light prosthetics created for para-Olympian cyclists. 
They&apos;ve checked out an electric vehicle battery charger that maker Phoenix Contact says can give an car battery 100 kilometers worth of charge in just five minutes. 
And Obama has tried on virtual reality glasses made with what developer Ifm Stiftung dubs the smallest 3D camera in the world. 
With the glasses on his face and cameras snapping photos, Obama reached out as if shaking an invisible hand. 
He says, &quot;It&apos;s a brave new world.&quot; Latest in section

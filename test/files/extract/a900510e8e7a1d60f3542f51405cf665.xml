The floods in Houston last week destroyed thousands of homes, caused an estimated $5 billion in damages, and killed at least seven people.

Meanwhile, the Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets continued to battle it out in the NBA playoffs. 
After game 4 of the series, a reporter asked Warrior player Draymond Green an awkward question, presumably to try and get a controversial statement about the floods: 
“Draymond, here’s an interesting question. So last year you visit [Houston], Game 3 there’s no flood, you win. Game 4, there was flood, you lose. This year you visit [Houston], Game 3 there’s a flood, you lose. Game 4, there’s no flood, you win. Does that mean…?” 
The reporter was obviously trying to attribute the Warriors’ 21 three-pointers to the rains that flooded Houston—but Green was not falling for it. 
Green stopped him right there and made a classy, minute-long statement that left everyone’s jaws on the floor: 
“People are losing their homes, losing their cars, losing their lives, losing loved ones, and you’re trying to get a controversial statement out of me…”

The reporter has not been named at this time. The Warriors and Rockets face each other again on April 27th.

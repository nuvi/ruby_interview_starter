Jordan has urged Israel to keep Israeli &quot;settlers&quot; from a Muslim-run shrine that also ranks as Judaism&apos;s holiest site. 
Jordan serves as custodian of the Jerusalem compound where Muslims believe their prophet ascended to heaven. Jews revere it as the home of their biblical Temples. 
The site has sparked tensions. During Jewish holidays, such as the current Passover, more Jews visit, including some religious zealots, referred to by Muslims as &quot;settlers.&quot; 
Jordanian spokesman Mohammed Momani urged Israel on Sunday to keep out &quot;settlers&quot; and warned of consequences if tensions flare. Jordan and Israel have close security ties. 
The Israeli prime minister&apos;s office said Monday that &quot;Israel is acting responsibly.&quot; 
Police said 204 Israelis visited Monday, along with 638 tourists. Police say three Israelis were escorted out for attempting to pray.

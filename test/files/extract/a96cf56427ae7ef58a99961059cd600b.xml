Toronto artist, Teva Harrison, draws her journey through terminal cancer Teva Harrison says disease &apos;can be diminishing&apos; but drawing helps her forget By Jonathan Rumley, CBC News Posted: Apr 25, 2016 2:34 PM ET Last Updated: Apr 25, 2016 2:34 PM ET In response to her terminal cancer diagnosis, Teva Harrison began to draw comics to deal with her emotions. Her art became a published memoir known as In-Between Days. (Teva Harrison/Facebook) Related Stories (Note: CBC does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external links.) 
Teva Harrison was in her mid-30s when she started feeling a pain in her back and hips. 
The Toronto visual artist first thought the pain was part of getting older. Even carrying bags of groceries was a struggle for Harrison. Training for a half-marathon at the time, her doctor figured she might have injured herself. 
Palliative care improves quality of life, but patients link it with death 
After she found a lump in her breast a couple of months later, she discovered she had stage four cancer. 
&quot;I felt like the floor had fell out from under me,&quot; she said on CBC Radio&apos;s Metro Morning . &quot;I remember hearing the words: &apos;We&apos;re no longer looking for a cure.&apos;&quot; 
She continued: &quot;I remember feeling really lost.&quot; &apos;It can be diminishing&apos; 
In response to her terminal diagnosis, she began to draw comics to deal with her emotions. The result is a published graphic memoir called In-Between Days , which is about living with cancer. 
&quot;Cancer makes a lot of people feel really uncomfortable,&quot; she explained to host Matt Galloway. &quot;People don&apos;t necessarily know what to say. And in not knowing what to say, they pull away.&quot; 
Harrison said people in her life either vanished or looked at her with &quot;sad eyes.&quot; 
&quot;It can be diminishing,&quot; she said, adding that when people look at her that way, she feels like they don&apos;t see a person; they see the cancer. 
&quot;Yes, I have this disease and this disease will eventually kill me, but until then, I&apos;m me.&quot; 
She said she is living with metastatic breast cancer, which has invaded several parts of her body. She noted since the diagnosis, the disease has spread to her liver. 
&quot;I don&apos;t have as much energy as I used to have,&quot; she admitted. &quot;My pain is well managed.&quot; &apos;Drawing is a reprieve&apos; 
Harrison said her cancer forces her to choose how she wants to spend the few hours of energy she has in her day. 
&quot;Regardless of what&apos;s going on in my life, cancer takes precedence,&quot; she explained. &quot;It&apos;s always going to be first.&quot; 
Fortunately for Harrison, she has found a way to make herself feel good about life through art. 
&quot;Drawing is a reprieve,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s like a break from rumination.&quot; 
She explained how the art of thinking through what she wants to draw, acting on it and executing it helps her forget her everyday issues. 
&quot;I get to escape into the flow of an act that has nothing to do with actually being sick.&quot; 
Even if her drawing relates to cancer, she said she still feels good doing it. 
&quot;It&apos;s a gift.&quot;

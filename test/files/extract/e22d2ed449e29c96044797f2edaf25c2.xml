Oh, Melissa Click, you just can&apos;t help yourself, can you?
After being fired by the University of Missouri for assaulting a student journalist during a protest and threatening to call for &quot;muscle&quot; to intimidate him, Click has not been able to go quietly into the unemployment line. First she claimed that she acted the way she did because she thought the student journalist with a camera might have had a gun . So her response to this was to try to get other students (the &quot;muscle&quot;) into harm&apos;s way. Okay.
But now Click is back with a new claim. She now says she was fired due to &quot; racial politics .&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m a white lady. I&apos;m an easy target,&quot; Click told the Chronicle of Higher Education.

By John Siciliano • 04/25/16 2:37 PM The Chronicle paraphrased her as saying she was fired to send a message that the university and state of Missouri wouldn&apos;t tolerate black people standing up to white people. I don&apos;t see how that would result in a white person getting fired, but then nothing this woman — a former assistant professor of communications — has said in this episode makes much sense.
Click embodied everything non-protesters have seen since the campus crybullies began making ludicrous demands to their universities. She was boorish, demanding and incited violence against someone who was doing nothing wrong. She was the epitome of a leftist-professor trying to trample free speech rights in order to protect her narrative.
And now she&apos;s adopting the narrative of many who don&apos;t support the protesters; the ones who say much of the racism is now being directed at white students simply for being white or for refusing to kowtow to the protesters&apos; demands that they apologize for being white. Funny how quickly a person&apos;s narrative can change when she&apos;s the one being crucified.
Click was charged with assault for what she did, but avoided prosecution by committing to community service. She was eventually fired from the university as well.

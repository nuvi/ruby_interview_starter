Lady McLegends coach Burnetta Mack didn&apos;t have a gas gauge nearby.
She just must have figured they had enough left in the tank.
Mack issued the challenge with the McLegends sitting on 86 points with four minutes remaining in Friday night&apos;s game against the 2016 High School Senior All-Stars.
&quot;Let&apos;s go for 100,&quot; she said.
And then they went for it. With 17 seconds left and three points away, Alanna Ferry drew a foul while shooting a 3-pointer.
Swish. Swish. Gulp. Swish.
It was quite the capper on a 100-75 victory in the first of two McLegends games at Rich Central.
The McLegends men&apos;s game will be held at 2 p.m. Saturday.
The dominator all night for the McLegends was former Rich East and Grambling standout Tonishea Mack, who had a game-high 31 points. Briana Dunlap (Hillcrest/Miami of Ohio) added 11 points and Roslyn Turner (Bloom/Calumet) and Nadia Bibbs (Hillcrest/Northwestern) each had 10.

Ferry&apos;s gulp occurred after she had already hit the first two free throws.
&quot;I didn&apos;t realize it at first until I looked up and saw 99 on the scoreboard,&quot; said Ferry, the former Marian Catholic standout. &quot;Then the pressure kind of came on. But it went in, so it worked out.&quot;
Tonishea Mack, meanwhile, put on a show during the first quarter, converting a pair of 3-pointers along with three other baskets and a free throw as the McLegends built a 24-12 lead.
Among all of the Lady McLegends, the coach&apos;s niece Tonishea was without question the biggest Mack.
&quot;We were just out there having fun,&quot; Mack said with a laugh. &quot;That&apos;s what we all came out here to do. It was fun to get out there and beat (the All-Stars) up a little bit.&quot;
Being in Rich Central&apos;s gym brought back good memories for Tonishea Mack, who is the assistant women&apos;s coach at Governors State.

I always had good games here. If it wasn&apos;t scoring-wise, it was being a leader on the floor.&quot;
Friday, she added another one to her memory book.
All of the McLegends, really, looked comfortable and in control. The High School All-Stars never got closer than seven points after the first quarter.
&quot;It felt normal because we&apos;ve been playing together in pro-am leagues,&quot; Mack said. &quot;Me, Nadia Bibbs, Briana Dunlap, Morriah Smith, Kaila Turner, Chaz Duson, we&apos;ve all been playing together since high school. This was like an open gym scrimmage.&quot;
Bibbs, meanwhile, saved her best for last, hitting for a pair of 3-pointers early in the fourth quarter to expedite the McLegends&apos; pullaway.
&quot;I was a little under the weather,&quot; Bibbs said. &quot;I think I ate some bad food on Thursday. I took some (Pepto-Bismol) during warmups. I guess it finally started to work.&quot;
Johnson, a Robert Morris recruit, was the top perimeter producer for the High School All-Stars, hitting for three 3-pointers.
&quot;It was just fun to come out and play against the McLegends,&quot; she said. &quot;We expected them to be physical, but we didn&apos;t expect it from all of them. We tried to fight, but they&apos;ve got game. We were trying to learn from the best.&quot;

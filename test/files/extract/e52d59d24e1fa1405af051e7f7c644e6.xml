Sports Xchange Monday 25th April, 2016 SAN DIEGO -- The bottom two hitters in the Cardinals&apos; batting order enjoyed the weekend at Petco Park in San Diego.
And neither former Padre Jedd Gyorko or shortstop Aledmys Diaz started Friday night&apos;s game. 
Gyorko was 6-for-11 for the series with two homers, a triple, four RBIs and three runs scored. He had three hits both Saturday and Sunday. 
Diaz was even better. He went 9-for-11 with a homer, two doubles, three RBIs and two runs scored. At one point in the series, he had seven straight hits and raised his batting average from .387 to .480. 
Diaz raised his batting average 93 points in three days. Gyorko jumped 104 points to .289. And the duo connected on back-to-back homers Sunday to erase a 5-3 Padres lead and set up the Cardinals&apos; winning rally. 
It was Gyorko&apos;s first games at Petco Park since the Padres traded him to St. Louis last winter in exchange for center fielder Jon Jay. When he was introduced as a pinch-hitter Friday night, Gyorko was booed. 
&quot;I hope when I go back to St. Louis that they boo me because this worked out pretty well,&quot; joked Gyorko. &quot;Honestly, I didn&apos;t know what to expect. If they want to do their thing and boo me, then whatever.&quot; 
&quot;I think especially when he got the reception that he got, it was nice for Jedd to come back and stick it to the team that he was with before,&quot; said Cardinals manager Mike Matheny. share this story

Carnegie Spring Swing Fling filled the historic building with people and music at Saturday&apos;s event The sounds of jazz music emanated from the historic walls of The CarnegieBuilding in Crookston Saturday evening, as a Spring Swing Fling fundraiser was held, with proceeds going toward efforts to restore Crookston’s onetime public library.

The sounds of jazz music emanated from the historic walls of The CarnegieBuilding in Crookston Saturday evening, as a Spring Swing Fling fundraiser was held, with proceeds going toward efforts to restore Crookston’s onetime public library. A nice crowd came out to take in the music, bid on silent auction items, and dance the night away to tunes from the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. By Times Report

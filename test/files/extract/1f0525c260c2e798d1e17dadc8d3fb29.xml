On Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit of New York reinstated Brady’s four-game suspension following the NFL’s appeal on March 3. In a 33-page document, which highlights the ruling, the court wrote, “We hold that the Commissioner properly exercised his broad discretion under the collective bargaining agreement and that his procedural rulings were properly grounded in that agreement and did not deprive Brady of fundamental fairness. Accordingly, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND with instructions to confirm the award.” The NFL was fighting U.S. District Judge Richard Berman’s decision to vacate Brady’s four-game suspension last year. The ruling allowed the Patriots quarterback to play during the 2015 season. In March, in New York, three judges – Robert Katzmann, Barrington Parker and Denny Chin – heard arguments led by led by Paul Clement (for the NFL) and Jeffrey Kessler (for the NFL Players Association). In the end, this ruling was never about whether Brady was actually involved in a scheme to deflate footballs prior to the 2014 AFC Championship Game. Nor was it about whether Roger Goodell’s punishment fit the crime. For the three judges, as Parker wrote on Monday, their job was to determine whether the arbitration proceedings and award met the minimum legal standards established by the Labor Management Relations Act. In the NFL’s collective bargaining agreement, Goodell has near-unlimited power and that hurt Brady the most. “The Commissioner was authorized to impose discipline for, among other things, “conduct detrimental to the integrity of, or public confidence, in the game of professional football,” Parker wrote. “In their collective bargaining agreement, the players and the League mutually decided many years ago that the Commissioner should investigate possible rule violations, should impose appropriate sanctions, and may preside at arbitrations challenging his discipline. “Our review of the record yields the firm conclusion that the Commissioner properly exercised his broad discretion to resolve an intramural controversy between the League and a player.” Though the process the NFL used during this ordeal has been messy, according to the CBA and the law, Goodell and the league didn’t step outside their bounds. Among the many things that Brady’s legal team has argued is that there has never been any factual evidence tying him to a ball tampering scheme. Even the science used in the Wells Report seemed flawed as dozens of scientists have rushed to the defense of the Patriots over the past year. But as the three judges in New York ruled Monday, those facts never mattered. Written in Monday’s documents, the judges even admit that their review of this case was “very limited.” “We are therefore not authorized to review the arbitrator’s decision on the merits despite allegations that the decision rests on factual errors or misinterprets the parties’ agreement, but inquire only as to whether the arbitrator acted within the scope of his authority as defined by the collective bargaining agreement.” For Goodell, Article 46 of the CBA weighed heaviest in his favor. It gives him power to take “disciplinary action” against a player whom he thinks engaged in “conduct detrimental” to the league. At the March 3 hearing, the judges even stated that Brady not handing his cell phone over to the NFL during the investigation could be defined as conduct detrimental. Last year, Judge Berman vacated Brady’s suspension on three accounts – lack of notice (Brady didn’t know he could be suspended for what happened), exclusion of testimony from NFL lawyer Jeff Pash and denial of access to notes from the Wells Report. But on Monday, the court concluded that “each of these grounds is insufficient to warrant vacatur and that none of the Association’s remaining arguments have merit.” By Mark Daniels

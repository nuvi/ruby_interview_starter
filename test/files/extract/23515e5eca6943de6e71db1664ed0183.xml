I recently spoke with an Israeli friend who learned to speak German fluently after living in Germany for only a year and a half. Already after six months living there, she became extremely conversational in German. What were her secrets? With her tips and others I’ve gleaned, here is some advise for learning German – or any language.
1. Desire. My friend was much more determined than her peers to learn German. You must really want to learn the language to overcome the early hurdles involved. She remembered how all of her friends in her educational program wouldn’t bother to take museum brochures, while she consumed them, just as she did with anything written in German.  She had the basic ingredient: desire.
2. Take a course.  Naturally, my friend took a course, but a course will only go so far if you don&apos;t apply what you learned and actually attempt to converse.
3. Insist on speaking German. In major German cities, you could get by with English. Don’t let Germans speak English with you! Insist on speaking German, even if you think you’re imposing and even if their English is better than your German. They might appreciate the effort and become your best teachers.
4. Find a tandem partner. Through the Facebook group &quot;Tandem Deutsch-Hebraisch&quot; , I found a tandem partner, or rather, a German &quot;tutor.&quot; For an hour a week on Skype, I teach her Hebrew, and she teaches my German. It’s cheap, fun, and maybe you’ll make a new friend!
5. Immerse yourself. You must immerse yourself in the language and get out of the English-speaking bubble. German crystallized for my friend once she started working with children who could speak with her only German. This forced her never to fall back on English.
6. Use apps and software. There are plenty of apps and programs to help you build your basic vocabulary. Duolingo is a good app for when you want to learn on-the-go. It doesn’t spell out the rules, but figuring them out is much more stimulating than Candy Crush! Memrize seems to focus on vocabulary. For computer software, Babbel provides more tutorials about German grammar and sentence-building. And there are many more....
7. Watch movies in German. Turn on German subtitles or watch German films with English subtitles so that you could integrate all the theoretical knowledge you’ve learned about the language.
8. Listen to Disney songs in German! And now for my favorite: if you were a Disney junkie like me, then go to YouTube and find the German-dubbed Disney songs! You&apos;ll be able to figure out the words by association and internalize their use, as well as memorize some useful phrases like &quot;Sei ein Mann&quot; (&quot;Be A Man -  Mulan ) and &quot;Einmal in Traum&quot; (&quot;Once Upon a Dream&quot; -  Sleeping Beauty ). To get you inspired, here I am, leading the way with one of Disney&apos;s best!

[ACCESSWIRE]
VANCOUVER, BC Minaurum Gold Inc. (TSXV: MGG) (&quot;Minaurum&quot;) is pleased to update its shareholders on developments at the Biricu Project located in the Guerrero Gold Belt.
As previously disclosed on November 4 and December 4, 2015, Minaurum loaned Guerrero Ventures Inc. (&quot;Guerrero&quot;) funds to explore Biricu. Guerrero has informed Minaurum that the required exploration expenditures and obligations of the underlying Biricu option agreement between Alamos Gold Inc. and Guerrero have been fulfilled. Results from the exploration work are pending.
Guerrero has submitted all required documentation to Alamos Gold Inc. to exercise its option to acquire a 100-per-cent interest in the project.
The Biricu Project comprises more than 41,000 hectares of highly prospective intrusive rock types identical to those seen in Goldcorp&apos;s neighbouring Los Filos Mine and Torex Gold&apos;s nearby El Limon deposit.
Steve Maynard, the Vice President Exploration of Minaurum and a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101, has reviewed and approved, but has not verified, the technical data in this release due to the technical data having been prepared by Guerrero.
Minaurum Gold is a gold-copper explorer with a portfolio of projects in Mexico. For more information, please visit our website at www.minaurum.com and our YouTube Minaurum Video Channel ( http://www.minaurum.com/s/VideoGallery.asp ).

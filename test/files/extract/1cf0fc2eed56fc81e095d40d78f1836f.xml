According to BCSO, deputies responded to a domestic dispute between two brothers in southwest Albuquerque. Deputies say the suspect, Oscar Valadez, was threatening his brother with a knife and tried to flee the scene when deputies arrived. 
Valadez was ignoring commands to drop the weapons so deputies deployed a K-9 named Rex to apprehend the suspect. At that point, Valadez began to stab Rex and hit him in the head with the bat. Valadez the turned the knife on himself, trying to stab and cut his own throat. 
Deputies tased Valadez to prevent him from hurting himself. BCSO says Valadez was trying to injure himself through the collar of a big jacket so he only sustained minimal injuries. He was taken to UNM Hospital for treatment and later booked into MDC. 
BSCO says Valadez has an extensive criminal history. He is now facing several felony charges for the incident including, Agg Assault on a Peace Officer, Agg Assault with a deadly weapon, Serious injuries to a police dog and Extreme Animal Cruelty. 
Rex was taken to an emergency vet for tests and treatment. 
BSCO will provide updates on Rex’s conditions as they become available.

25 April 2016 - 6:24pm | posted by Minda Smiley Vitamin maker Sundown Naturals promotes its ‘Shmorange’ bottles in campaign out of Droga5 
It turns out that food companies aren’t the only ones touting their gluten-free, preservative-free products in an effort to appeal to changing consumer tastes. Vitamin maker Sundown Naturals is the latest brand to shout about its healthy offerings with a campaign created by Droga5 called ‘Shmorange’ that promotes its vitamins sans gluten, dairy or artificial flavors. 
In four spots, the brand plays off of its signature orange bottles by describing its vitamins as “shmorange,” a made-up word that means “to contain no gluten, dairy or artificial flavors.” 
The humorous videos feature a Sundown Naturals spokesperson as he tries to gather excitement for the ‘Shmorange’ vitamins, but becomes frustrated when a baby can’t pronounce the word and a millennial is more concerned with the “hearts with sparkles emoji.” 
Sundown Naturals is owned by health and wellness company NBTY, which named Droga5 as its agency of record last year. Earlier this year, Droga5 rolled out two videos for NBTY’s joint supplement brand Osteo Bi-Flex.

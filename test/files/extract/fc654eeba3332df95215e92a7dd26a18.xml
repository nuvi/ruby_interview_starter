Bernie Sanders offered a new explanation this weekend for why he isn’t defeating Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary, when asked by Chuck Todd about his recent string of defeats: 
“Well, because poor people don’t vote. That’s just a fact. That’s a sad reality of American society.” 
Sanders is channeling his inner Karl Marx here, making the mammoth assumption that the working classes inevitably support the socialist cause and would unite to overthrow the current system if not for the established capitalist class keeping them at bay. 
He’s right that less financially secure Americans are less likely to vote than their wealthier counterparts, for a range of reasons. But Sanders is wrong when he simply concludes that poor people, if they did vote in bigger numbers, would be flocking to pull the lever for him. 
The easiest response, as pointed out by the Washington Post , is that among the poor voters who are voting this year, Sanders is still losing: 
It’s not clear that larger turnout among poor voters would have actually helped Sanders against Clinton, however. Sanders has lost Democratic voters with household incomes below $50,000 by 55 percent to 44 percent to Clinton across primaries where network exit polls have been conducted. 
So Sanders is already facing an 11-point deficit with the working class voters who are managing to get to the polls this year, putting a major dent in his flawed argument that America’s poor neighborhoods are teeming with democratic-socialists. 
But even among the poor who aren’t voting, there’s little evidence of a dormant volcano of Democratic support, for Sanders, Clinton, or otherwise. 
A recent Pew Research study made an interesting finding: while 42% of the poorest voters said they preferred Democrats and just 17% aligned with Republicans, 41% said they didn’t prefer either. Source: Pew Research 
Why aren’t poor voters flocking to align with the Democratic Party? After all, voting Democrat is in their best interest (or so Democrats say.) But the Democrats make a mistake when they assume – like Bernie – that all poor voters support the social safety net and welfare programs. 
As the New York Times learned last year, many poor voters in rural areas who themselves have used government benefits at times see a system ripe with flaws and dependency: 
But on another level, these voters are consciously opting against a Democratic economic agenda that they see as bad for them and good for other people — specifically, those undeserving benefit-recipients who live nearby. I’ve heard variations on this theme all over the country: people railing against the guy across the street who is collecting disability payments but is well enough to go fishing, the families using their food assistance to indulge in steaks. 
Are these poorer voters actually voting against their own self-interest, as liberals claim? That’s an economic discussion for another day. 
However, Democrats make a grave mistake when they broadly assume, like Bernie Sanders just did, that poor Americans are all Democratic voters in-waiting. Because even if more poor Americans did vote, not only is there no guarantee they’d be flocking to Sanders; there’s not even a guarantee they’d vote Democrat.

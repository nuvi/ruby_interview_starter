Hornets&apos; Batum out, Whiteside a game-time decision for Heat - WECT TV6-WECT.com:News, weather &amp; sports Wilmington, NC Member Center: Hornets&apos; Batum out, Whiteside a game-time decision for Heat 2016-04-25T16:13:19Z 2016-04-25T16:13:19Z 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Charlotte Hornets forward Nicolas Batum has been ruled out for Game 4 against Miami, while Heat center Hassan White&apos;s status will be a game-time decision in their first round series Monday night. 
Miami leads the series 2-1. 
Hornets coach Steve Clifford said Monday Batum was unable to participate in shootaround and will miss his second straight game with a strained foot. The Hornets beat the Heat 96-80 in Game 3 despite Batum&apos;s absence. 
Whiteside got hit in the thigh on a pick and roll in the fourth quarter of Saturday night&apos;s game and hasn&apos;t practiced since. 
Whiteside said he will see how the thigh feels before the game prior to making a decision on whether or not to play. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

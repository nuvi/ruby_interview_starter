Cruz invites Trump to debate in Ind. WHAS11.com Staff , WHAS 11:59 AM. CDT April 25, 2016 Ted Cruz at rally in Borden, Ind. at Huber&apos;s Orchard and Winery. 
BORDEN, Ind. (WHAS11) -- Hours after announcing a major strategy shift with a competitor, Ted Cruz brought his Republican Presidential campaign to Southern Indiana. 
About 350 to 400 people were here at Huber&apos;s Orchard and Winery. 
This was Senator Cruz&apos;s first appearance since agreeing to compete alone against Trump in Indiana in exchange for back up on Oregon and New Mexico so John Kasich could compete alone against Trump in those states. 
The Indiana primary is just eight days away and Cruz called on a quote from the movie Hoosiers about &quot;two kinds of stupid people.” 
He denied that the effort with Kasich was a sign of desperation and instead called Trump desperate. He described Trump as &quot;cowering&quot; and unwilling to debate in Indiana. 
“And so I want to extend an invitation for Donald to come to Indiana, have a debate here in Indiana, a town hall with Hoosiers asking the questions,” Cruz said. “You know Donald never shies away from telling us how big and strong…he is. Well, if he&apos;s so big and strong and tough stop hiding in Trump Tower in New York City and show up and show the humility to stand before the people of Indiana and answer their questions.”

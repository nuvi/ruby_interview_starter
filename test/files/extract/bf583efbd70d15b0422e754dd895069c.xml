 17 AM EDT Waterproofing Chemicals Market 2016-2020 Industry exmined by Syndicate Market Research 
Waterproofing chemicals are additives that are used to safeguard from leakages. These chemicals are added with other chemical constituents to increase the performance of the finished product. Waterproofing chemicals are added to compounds like cement, mortar, plastics, paints, colors, inks, and detergents. Waterproofing chemicals are exercised in applications like building and construction, polymer processing, paints &amp; coatings, printing inks and among other. 
Major driving factor of global waterproofing chemicals market is rapid increase demand from building and construction application segment. Due to the ever increasing population, construction activities are increasing across the globe. This in turn, production of sustainable building materials like waterproofing admixtures, adhesives &amp; sealants and membranes increases. Growing activity of infrastructure development such as bridge and road construction in developing countries is also expected to fuel the demand for waterproofing chemicals. However, fluctuating raw material prices and stringent government policies are major restraint that is expected to limit the growth of the waterproofing chemicals market.

Will Smith is taking on the role of Deadshot, his first comic book character since Hancock and a lot of people are excited to see him along with Margot Robbie bring our beloved crazy anti-hero Harley Quinn to our big screens. 
A new still has been released of the two sharing a lovely moment during the film. I can’t wait to see them both this Summer along with Jared Leto as the Joker, Suicide Squad will be in our cinemas from August 5th. 
It feels good to be bad… Assemble a team of the world’s most dangerous, incarcerated Super Villains, provide them with the most powerful arsenal at the government’s disposal, and send them off on a mission to defeat an enigmatic, insuperable entity. U.S. intelligence officer Amanda Waller has determined only a secretly convened group of disparate, despicable individuals with next to nothing to lose will do. However, once they realize they weren’t picked to succeed but chosen for their patent culpability when they inevitably fail, will the Suicide Squad resolve to die trying, or decide it’s every man for himself?

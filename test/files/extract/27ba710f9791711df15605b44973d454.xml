Cruz responded: 
Listen, I dont doubt that Donald Trump is going to scream and yell and curse and insult and probably cry and whine some as well, that has been Donalds pattern. Now I recognize everyone got all excited because last week Donald won his home state. 14 posted on 04/25/2016 11:29:25 AM PDT by TTFX To: Sybeck1 No, no, it&apos;s not a double cross, it&apos;s a Carson.
Next thing you know he&apos;ll be in the closet with Kasich trying to work things out by saying he didn&apos;t know a thing about this. 15 posted on 04/25/2016 11:30:10 AM PDT by Rashputin (Jesus Christ doesn&apos;t evacuate His troops, He leads them to victory !!)

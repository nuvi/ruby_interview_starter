This leaves tenants constantly having to assess the risk to reward ratio. With reputable furnished apartment companies you will never have to worry about the risks that accompany illegal businesses like Airbnb.

Know What You’re Getting in a Furnished Apartment 
Because of the undercurrent of possible risk when using Airbnb, you have to be knowledgeable and educate yourself about the service. Be wary of misleading ads, dwelling descriptions, and reviews that may be fabricated. Even if you believe the individual hosting the rental is trustworthy, research the environment around the property including neighbors and noise. 
A credible furnished housing company, like Alternative Business Accommodations , should provide you with transparency in regards to the parties involved and the immediate surroundings of the rental. Their site should include multiple photos of the apartment, the name of the building and it’s amenities, local services, public transportation options as well as a map of the neighborhood.

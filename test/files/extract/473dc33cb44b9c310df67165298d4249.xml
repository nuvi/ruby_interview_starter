MORE than 100 tractors chugged through the lanes of North Yorkshire on Sunday to raise money for a hospital&apos;s intensive care unit. 
Stank Hall Tractor Run, which started from the farm in Kirby Sigston, near Northallerton , took place in memory of Jonathan Chapman, from Ingleby Arncliffe, who died in a car accident near Hutton Rudby last year. 
The 20-year-old agricultural engineer was a vintage tractor enthusiast.

Before the convoy of tractors set off on Sunday, they held a 30 second &quot;rev-up&quot;, instead of a minute&apos;s silence, in memory of Jonathan. 
Organiser Liam Gouldthorpe said once entry fees and sponsorship money from local firms had been counted, he expected the event to have raised more than £2,000, which will be donated to the intensive care unit at Middlesbrough&apos;s James Cook University Hospital, which treated Jonathan, and his friend John Noble, from Stokesley , who suffered serious head injuries in the crash. 
&quot;The weather was on our side for most of the day, so we did pretty well,&quot; said Mr Gouldthorpe. Share:

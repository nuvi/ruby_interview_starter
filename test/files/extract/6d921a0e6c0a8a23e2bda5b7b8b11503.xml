Another week, another boat load of new and fun apps to download. This week, we’ve got a game that hurls an endless amount of asteroids to a planet, an app that tells you what’s going on in space, and a barebones RSS reader app for Android that supports multiple users. Check them out, as you enter the last week of April.
Protect the Planet protect More Earth Day may have passed, but that’s no reason for you to stop protecting planets. This barebones Android and iOS game has an endless number of purple and pink asteroids hurling through space, vying to hit this one, small, nameless planet. Thankfully, this planet has a moon (that’s you) to protect it, by slamming and breaking up these massive rocks before they hit the planet. Debris from asteroids you smash break up other asteroids, which is how you rack up your combo score. What’s neat is that the more you protect the planet, the more it grows — with a dragon flying around it, followed by a blimp, a satellite, and more. You can also collect coins during the game and purchase different moon “skins,” like replacing it with the Death Star, or a basketball.

Give to Receive give to receive More When people give money to charities, they typically don’t expect something in return — well, except for feeling better about themselves. Give to Receive wants to change that, by letting you get a physical product in return. Say you decide to donate $50 to a partnered charity in the app, you’ll then get 50 points in return. Head over to the reward section of the app, and you’ll be able to exchange those points for a product, like say, an Amazon Fire tablet, which costs 50 points. As the app grows, so will the amount of partnered charities, as well as the number of products to reward your philanthropy with.

Solaris Sky Calendar ($2) solaris More Our calendars may be busy here on earth, but there’s a whole of things happening above our heads in space — from meteor showers to solar eclipses. If you want to stay current with the ongoings of our planetary system, download Solaris Sky Calendar. This well-designed app offers a calendar of events of what’s going to happen next in space, and offers detailed descriptions about them. There are even easter eggs within the app, and finding them opens up more fun information about the universe, such as “times Solar System bodies rise and set.” The app costs $2.

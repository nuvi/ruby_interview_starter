SEOUL--Hanjin Shipping Co., South Korea&apos;s largest container operator, has applied for a creditor-led debt restructuring to avoid bankruptcy, reviving talk of a possible merger with rival Hyundai Merchant Marine Co.
Hanjin, a unit of Hanjin Group, which also controls Korean Air Lines Co., on Monday submitted a formal request to state-run Korea Development Bank, its main creditor, to restructure its debt and provide an aid package in return for self-rescue efforts such as asset sales. Hanjin&apos;s shares plunged by the daily limit of 30% to a record low of 1,825 won ($1.59) as investors fretted about the future of the company.
A KDB spokesman said Hanjin Group Chairman Cho Yang-ho also had offered to hand management control of the company over to creditors.
KDB said it would review the proposal with other creditors and decide by next week whether to offer assistance to Hanjin, which might include a debt rollover. If creditors reject the proposal, the company would be put under court receivership.
Shipping companies world-wide have been hit by years of slumping demand, particularly from China, forcing some to sell vessels at a discount to survive. A handful of smaller operators have already gone bankrupt.
South Korean Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho said last week that if ailing Korean shipping companies can&apos;t undertake an industrywide restructuring themselves, the government would take action, including forcing some firms into receivership.
Hanjin and Hyundai Merchant Marine, which handle the bulk of South Korea&apos;s exports, have been unprofitable for several years, amassing debts in a global shipping market awash in excess capacity and plummeting prices.
Hanjin had debt of 6.6 trillion won ($5.7 billion), with a debt-to-equity ratio of nearly 850%, at the end of 2015. Hyundai is burdened by 4.8 trillion won in debt and its gross outstanding debt outweighs its equity by a ratio of almost 16 to 1.
Korean companies have been pressured by growing consolidation in the shipping business, where global operators are adding bigger ships and forming vessel-sharing alliances that reduce operating costs and give them more pricing leverage.
KDB Chairman Lee Dong-gul said last month the creditors will look into various ways to streamline the nation&apos;s shipping industry and a merger between Hanjin and Hyundai Merchant Marine could be an option after acquiring controlling stakes in the troubled shipping lines via a debt-equity swap.
Officials at Hanjin and Hyundai Merchant Marine said Monday they are unaware of any current merger talks between the two companies.
&quot;The decision is up to the government, but consolidation is a good option for ship operators to save costs and regain negotiating power when borrowing ships,&quot; said HI Investment &amp; Securities analyst Ha Jun-young.
Some of the world&apos;s biggest container operators, including China&apos;s Cosco Group and France&apos;s CMA CGM, last week agreed to form a new shipping group, called the Ocean Alliance, to challenge the dominance of giants Maersk Line and Mediterranean Shipping Co.
&quot;Anyone left alone out there won&apos;t be around for long,&quot; said a senior Korean shipping executive.

EUR/USD Current Price: 1.1275 View Live Chart for the EUR/USD There was little action across the forex board this Monday, yet the dollar edged mostly lower against its major rivals, weighed by a modest decline in worldwide stocks. A sparse macroeconomic calendar and some soft readings in the US housing sector during the American afternoon saw the greenback easing further ahead of Wall Street’s close. In the EU Germany released its IFO survey, which missed market’s expectations in April, but showed that sentiment remained stable, as the assessment of the current situation down to 113.2 from 113.6, and expectations up to 100.4, above March 100.0, but a tad below expectations of 100.8. In the US, New Home sales decreased 1.5% in March to a 511,000 annualized pace, missing the median forecast for a gain to 520,000. Markets attention is centered in the upcoming FED and BOJ’s meetings, both expected to shed some light over upcoming economic policies. And while the first is expected to take one step towards a new rate hike, the second is largely expected to maintain the easing path. The EUR/USD pair fell down to 1.1215 early Asia, but was unable to extend its decline below a major static support the 38.2% retracement of the latest daily advance around 1.1220, and dedicated the day to recover some ground, stretching up to 1.1277. The EUR may advance further, up to the 1.1310 region, the 23.6% retracement of the mentioned rally, given that in the 4 hours chart, the price is aiming to advance above a still bearish 20 SMA, whilst the technical indicators maintain bullish slopes within negative territory, but remain below their mid-lines. Support levels: 1.1250 1.1220 1.1160 Resistance levels: 1.1315 1.1340 1.1380 EUR/JPY Current price: 125.41 View Live Chart for the EUR/JPY The Japanese yen started the week with a strong footing, underpinned by safe-haven’s demand as stocks and commodities decline, and helped later on the day by comments coming from Japan´s Abe adviser Honda, who said that the BOJ can add some easing in June. Investors’ were selling the JPY on speculation the Bank of Japan was going to announce some additional easing as soon as next Thursday, and the suspected delay gave the currency a breath. Nevertheless, the yen turned lower in the US afternoon, as Wall Street trimmed early losses, resulting in the EUR/JPY pair surging to fresh daily highs of 125.45, as the common currency was also on demand. From a technical point of view, the pair maintains a mild positive tone as in the 4 hours chart, the technical indicators have turned north well above their mid-lines, whilst the intraday decline was unable to clearly extend below the 50% retracement of the latest daily decline around 124.95, still the main support. Should the current rally extend above 125.70, the 61.8% retracement of the same decline, the advance can extend up to 126.60, a strong static midterm resistance. Support levels: 124.95 124.50 124.00 Resistance levels: 125.70 126.25 126.60 GBP/USD Current price: 1.4492 View Live Chart for the GBP/USD The British Pound outperformed this Monday, rallying up to 1.4518 against the greenback, its highest since early February, with no clear catalyst behind Sterling’s strength. Data coming from the UK showed that manufacturing activity fell by less than expected in March, as the CBI Industrial Trends survey come in at -11 during the current month against -15 forecasted and up from March’s -14. Also, helping the Pound were some anti-Brexit rhetoric from UK authorities and new polls showing that the support for the Brexit plunged to 29% from previous 34%. The GBP/USD retreated from the mentioned high, but holds around the 1.4500 figure, maintaining a positive technical tone, as in the 4 hours chart, the price is well above a bullish 20 SMA, whilst the Momentum indicator continues heading north well above its 100 level and the RSI indicator consolidates around 70. Nevertheless a strong upward acceleration through the 1.4520 level is required to confirm additional gains for this Tuesday that can extend up to the 1.4600 region. Support levels: 1.4465 1.4420 1.4370 Resistance levels: 1.4520 1.4555 1.4600 USD/JPY Current price: 111.19 View Live Chart for the USD/JPY The USD/JPY pair advanced up to 111.88, but shed over 100 pips early US session, weighed by poor US data and market’s talks suggesting the BOJ may stay pat this month, and consider more easing in their June meeting. Yet the pair recovered above the 111.00 level ahead of the US close, closing the day in the red anyway. Not much should be expected for the pair during the upcoming sessions, as the US Federal Reserve will have its economic policy meeting late Wednesday, whilst the BOJ will do the same early Thursday. Anyway and from a technical point of view, the pair presents a persistent bullish tone, as in the 4 hours chart, the technical indicators have turned sharply higher within positive territory, after correcting previous overbought readings. Furthermore, the recovery above 111.00, in spite of stocks’ declines, suggests that JPY bulls have taken a step aside, whilst sellers are gathering pace. The downward potential is now seen limited, as long as the price manages to hold above 110.65, a strong static support zone. Support levels: 110.65 110.30 109.80 Resistance levels: 111.40 111.90 112.30 AUD/USD Current price: 0.7708 View Live Chart for the AUD/USD The AUD/USD pair is barely changed from its Friday’s close, with a holiday in Australia and New Zealand keeping local investors quiet at the beginning of the week, and soft commodities’ prices limiting the advance of the antipodean currency later in the day, in spite of broad dollar’s weakness. With no data scheduled for the upcoming session, the Aussie will likely keep on trading accordingly to oil and gold’s prices, which means the risk has turned towards the downside, at least in the short term. Holding a few pips above the daily low of 0.7690, the 4 hours chart shows that the 20 SMA heads sharply lower around 0.7750, now the immediate resistance, whilst the Momentum indicator consolidates below its 100 level and the RSI indicator anticipates some additional declines by heading lower around 41. A downward acceleration below the mentioned support can see the pair approaching the 0.7600/20 region, where long-term speculative buying interest may attempt to buy the pair back. Support levels: 0.7690 0.7655 0.7620 Resistance levels: 0.7750 0.7790 0.7835 Share this:

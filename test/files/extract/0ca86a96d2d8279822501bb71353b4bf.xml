C.J. Bryce ready for his follow-up act to hot freshman season with UNCW basketball By Eric Detweiler Published: Monday, April 25, 2016 at 1:14   25, 2016 at 1:23 p.m.

That bit of trivia aside, the UNCW freshman guard looked plenty comfortable battling   in that spotlight. He finished the 93-85 loss with 16 points and eight rebounds on 6-of-8 shooting in 32 minutes. 
For Bryce, it was a confidence-boosting end to his first year with the Seahawks and a reminder of the way he&apos;s got to approach the game to play his best. That edge was missing, at times, during a late-season slump. 
“It was just having that self-confidence,” said Bryce, who finished averaging 10.1 points per game on an impressive 53 percent shooting. “Earlier during the season, I wasn&apos;t looking over my shoulder as much. I feel like I started playing not to get taken out the game. That&apos;s something that I&apos;ve worked on with my mindset, just giving it my all when I&apos;m out there.” 
Bryce – with his smooth drives and surprisingly well-developed midrange game – had the inside track on Colonial Athletic Association Rookie of the Year honors until late in the regular season. The Charlotte native scored just 15 points in UNCW&apos;s last five games, allowing College of Charleston&apos;s Jarrell Brantley to swoop in and grab the award. 
Bryce didn&apos;t hit double figures in any of the three CAA Tournament wins, either. His three-point play with 1:20 left in overtime of the final win over Hofstra put the Seahawks ahead for good, though. 
Count that dip as part physical and part mental. He was nursing the bumps and bruises that come with a four-month season. “It was a little bit rougher than I thought it&apos;d be,” he said. And Keatts could afford to lean on a veteran back court if Bryce wasn&apos;t at his best. 
“I think he learned that as you mature you have to be consistent throughout the year,” Keatts said. “I don&apos;t think he ever wore down. I think he&apos;s young enough where he won&apos;t wear down. I just told him while it was happening that every guy has a two or three game period where they don&apos;t play well. Now what do you do to get out of it?” 
Bryce had more than a week leading up to the Duke game to think on that message. He came out attacking the Blue Devils like he was in a run-of-the-mill conference game. He scored six of UNCW&apos;s first 11 points and then heated up again once the Seahawks were pressing to stay close after halftime. 
Keatts had told his players leading up he believed they were ready to compete with anybody in the country. It took pushing Duke to the brink for Bryce to finally believe it. 
“We had a lot of fun,” Bryce said. “It was really eye-opening for the program.” 
Only Brett Blizzard and Adam Smith have scored more points than Bryce as freshmen for the Seahawks in the past 30 years. Now he&apos;s preparing for his follow-up act. His role shouldn&apos;t have to change dramatically with so many Seahawks coming back, but he should be able to earn more crunch-time minutes. 
Bryce is well on his way to becoming the stat-stuffer on both ends that Keatts advertised before the guard had ever played a college game. The coach has challenged him to improve 25 assists against 56 turnovers and to become more of a 3-point threat. 
Bryce may have mostly avoided the usual freshman growing pains, but he&apos;s keeping the bumps there were in mind during his first full offseason working under Keatts. 
“We want to get better,” Bryce said. “Everybody has to think that way going into next season for us to really be good. Just getting ready to go deeper in the tournament.”

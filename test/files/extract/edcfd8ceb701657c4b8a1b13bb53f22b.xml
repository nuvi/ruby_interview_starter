I just got back from Passover in New York City so I’m sorry this is so late. The good news is I am going to bullet point it so it will be quick. The bad news is that I am down to what will equal 1 cocktail and 2 shots of Jose. We went a little nuts trying to get through the RHOBH shit show, so now I’m low and with Dorinda’s man trouble, and Bethenny thinking her opinion matters, I might run out. Wish me well people. This might get ugly! I love you Jose!

Bethenny&apos;s voice is grating, and 90% of the show is her talking. It&apos;s pathetic and telling that she&apos;s using the autistic, heavily medicated Ramona as a &quot;friend&quot;. The fact Beth was Paris Hilton&apos;s nanny makes me think she&apos;s into the satanic occult group of Hollyweird and why they gave her this career, and why she&apos;ll never get an honest edit showing how awful of a person she is. Though you can tell anyways if you&apos;re observant. And the way she talks about her childhood but never says exactly what happens makes me think it could be satanic ritual abuse.
Your comments on Carol are hilarious and spot on. I agree 100% the look on her face and reaction to Jules saying she gets her period every month. Carol doesn&apos;t and I suspect even when she was young enough to she missed them. How can the two most obvious eating disorder girls go after a woman who is exceptionally tall, which makes anyone appear more thin?
I love Dorinda and John.
Sonja is endlessly fascinating. I hate her tagline though. Why does she have to say something so negative about herself?

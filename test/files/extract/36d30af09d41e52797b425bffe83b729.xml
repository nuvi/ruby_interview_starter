The alliance between Ted Cruz and John Kasich, barely 12 hours old, is already showing signs of fraying. The news that Donald Trump’s two remaining rivals had teamed up late in the game hit late Sunday night and immediately stoked the ire of Trump, who used his opponents&apos; &quot;collusion&quot; to underscore his core argument: The Republican establishment is corrupt and is rigging the system against the will of the voters.
The Cruz-Kasich pact, announced in separate statements issued just minutes apart, entails the Ohio governor ceding Indiana&apos;s May 3 primary to his Texan rival while Cruz stands down in New Mexico and Oregon. The math roughly works: Both New Mexico and Oregon award their 24 and 28 delegates proportionally, on June 7 and May 17, respectively, while Indiana&apos;s 57 delegates are winner-take-all by district and statewide.
But on Monday, no sooner did Cruz and Kasich make their first comments on the deal than they quickly cast its viability into doubt.
&quot;I&apos;ve never told them not to vote for me; they should vote for me,&quot; Kasich said during a prickly exchange with reporters at a Philadelphia diner.
&quot;I&apos;m not over there campaigning and spending resources. We have limited resources,&quot; he continued. &quot;Mine is like the people&apos;s campaign. I have a campaign where, you know, we&apos;ve been outspent basically 50-to-1. You folks have been counting me out before I even got to New Hampshire. And now we can&apos;t jam all of you into this diner. I mean, everybody chill out.&quot;
Kasich&apos;s chief strategist John Weaver quickly clarified the sentiment in a tweet, writing, &quot;We&apos;re not telling voters who to vote for in IN, only where we are going to spend resources to ultimately defeat Hillary. They get it.&quot;
Trump seized on the comments from Kasich hours later.
&quot;Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him,&quot; Trump wrote. &quot;Typical politician — can&apos;t make a deal work.&quot;
Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe and Weaver touched base in person while attending last week’s Republican National Committee spring meeting in Hollywood, Florida, and agreed to stay in touch, according to three sources briefed on the exchange. On Friday, they spoke by phone and agreed to make something happen — and that same day, Cruz aides were informed that a negotiation was in the works. A day later, they reached an agreement about a specific plan of action. At no point did Cruz or Kasich talk with each other about a prospective deal.
The alliance of sorts comes after Kasich finished March with a little more than $1.2 million in the bank, blowing through $4.6 million while raising $4.5 million. Cruz, meanwhile, raised $12.5 million in March, ending the month with $8.8 million on hand. And though anti-Trump groups are already putting dollars into Indiana — the Club for Growth last week announced it was spending $1.5 million on an ad declaring: “To stop Trump, Vote Cruz” — Trump, who recently signaled his willingness to spend $20 million in upcoming states, essentially has access to unlimited resources.
Trump adviser Barry Bennett mocked the agreement in an interview with CNN, calling it a “desperate act,” “bad strategy,” “bad theater,” “stupid deal” and “really pathetic.”
The new Cruz-Kasich pact is also a tacit admission that neither man can catch Trump before the Republican National Convention convenes in July. Cruz, once scornful of the &quot;fantasy&quot; of a contested convention, now openly admits that his only shot at the nomination entails beating Trump on a second or subsequent ballot in Cleveland. Kasich, as recently as last month, was dismissive of an alliance with Cruz, asking rhetorically, &quot;At the end of the day, how do you tell your people that are for you to go vote for somebody else?&quot;
Early Monday morning, Trump blasted his rivals&apos; nascent coordination, calling it &quot;often illegal in many other industries and yet these two Washington insiders have had to revert to collusion in order to stay alive.&quot; &quot;They are mathematically dead and this act only shows, as puppets of donors and special interests, how truly weak they and their campaigns are,&quot; Trump said, noting his large and growing lead. Thanks to his campaign, he concluded, &quot;everyone now sees that the Republican primary system is totally rigged.&quot;
Cruz and Kasich pushed back on that idea on Monday morning.
&quot;I said I think it&apos;s fair because, you know, in some places we haven&apos;t spent a lot of resources,&quot; Kasich said Monday as he explained how his campaign conferred with its Cruz counterparts. &quot;I didn&apos;t spend resources in the state of Wisconsin. Minor amount of spending. I don&apos;t have, you know, like Daddy Warbucks behind me giving me all this money. I have to be careful about my resources, but furthermore, the reason why I&apos;m in this race, is I&apos;m the only one that beats Hillary Clinton.&quot;
Cruz, addressing reporters before a rally in Borden, Indiana, said his alliance with Kasich is &quot;entirely about the will of the people&quot; and cast it as a pragmatic effort to stop a man who would lose badly in November.
&quot;This is about winning the votes of the Hoosier State, giving Indiana the opportunity to choose, and we’re at a fork in the road. We’re at a fundamental fork in the road,&quot; Cruz said. &quot;And I’ll tell you, here in the state of Indiana, Donald Trump at the top of the ticket losing in a landslide would cost Republicans seats all throughout the state of Indiana.&quot;
Cruz&apos;s morning rally in Borden is scheduled to be followed by a full day of campaigning in Indiana, including retail stops in Columbus and Greenwood, along with an evening rally in Franklin. Kasich&apos;s campaign, meanwhile, canceled its Indiana events and announced its first two stops in Oregon, scheduled for Thursday. (The governor will proceed with a fundraiser in Indianapolis, however.)
“Now, you know the fact is we don’t have all of the resources in the world, but we’re still going. And we have to husband our resources, and I feel that it’s very fair for me to be able to go to areas where I can spend my resources most effectively, and the same is true for Sen. Cruz,&quot; Kasich remarked at the diner. &quot;What’s the big deal?&quot;

I am urging all Trump voters to walk from voting for anyone in this presidential elections if the GOP screws over Trump. I don&apos;t think I will ever vote again and even go as far as voting for Clinton, If the GOP steals my vote. How can any real US citizen allow this to happen and how can Cruz and Kasish want to steal from The People...I quit...

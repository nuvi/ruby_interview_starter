TACOMA -- The Tacoma School District supplied bottled water to staff and students at two schools Monday, amid concerns of high lead levels in water. 
Parents and staff at Mann Elementary and Reed Elementary were notified Monday morning. 
According to a district spokesperson, &quot;higher than acceptable&quot; levels of lead were discovered in the water at the two south Tacoma schools during testing in May of 2015. 
The spokesperson said those test results were not reviewed until recent concerns were raised.

Beginning April 28, for the first time in 10 years, five planets in our solar system will be in retrograde. 
I&apos;ve heard the term hundreds of times, but, I admit, I&apos;ve never really understood how something happening so far away could affect us here on Earth. 
So, when I heard that not just one, but five heavenly bodies — Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Pluto, and Mercury — would be acting up this week, I had to look deeper into what this all really means. 
Jean Durkin , psychic medium and spiritual educator, said a couple times each year, while in orbit, Mercury will &quot;back up a little.&quot; 
&quot;When it does that, it messes with the electrical current that keeps everything going,&quot; she said. &quot;That&apos;s why people have problems with electronic devices during retrograde.&quot; 
Imagine the solar system is a lake and the water current is going in one steady direction. 
Now, imagine your pointer finger is the planet in retrograde. 
When you swish your finger in the water against the current, it causes a disruption in the ripples. 
That is sort of what retrograde does to the energy in the universe. 
&quot;When there are a number of planets in retrograde, it messes with the energy of our planet,&quot; Durkin said. &quot;It can start a domino effect because we&apos;re not paying attention to it.&quot; 
Man hopes to live 100 more years 
For example, during a past retrograde Durkin&apos;s remembers her cell phone&apos;s GPS malfunctioned, sending her far out of her way, which made her late for an appointment. 
&quot;Because I was late, I grabbed my bag real quick, it got stuck on the door handle and almost fell out of the truck,&quot; she said. 
By then she was also irritated and ready to snap. 
The disturbance in the force — I mean energy — causes that irritability. 
&quot;I really have to ground myself because I&apos;m an empath, so I pick up on everything,&quot; Durkin said. &quot;Yesterday I didn&apos;t do it and I was very out of sorts.&quot; 
Durkin was referring to April 21 which was during the beginning of the retrograde cycle. 
&quot;I was very moody and cranky,&quot; she said. &quot;Things really get to me during retrograde, so I have to stop and think about why I&apos;m getting so upset. Once I realized what was going on, I told myself to try and think of the positives.&quot; 
When a retrograde begins, Durkin said she &quot;grounds herself&quot; by meditating. 
&quot;I picture a white light coming down from heaven, over my whole body and into the ground,&quot; she said. &quot;Then it comes back up out of the ground, over my body and back up to heaven again.&quot; 
She sometimes does this twice a day during retrograde. 
Durkin said retrograde is a good time to reflect on your life. 
&quot;It&apos;s kind of like the universe&apos;s way of making you have down time to reflect and think and feel,&quot; she said. &quot;To contemplate your life.&quot; 
The upcoming five-planet retrograde will last approximately two weeks. 
&quot;Don&apos;t make any major decisions, don&apos;t sign any contracts,&quot; Durkin advised. &quot;I&apos;m going to take it easy. Even if the house is a mess, if I&apos;m exhausted, I&apos;m going to rest. Because if you&apos;re over-tired, you can make mistakes, do stupid things, and get hurt. 
&quot;You&apos;re better off going to bed.&quot;

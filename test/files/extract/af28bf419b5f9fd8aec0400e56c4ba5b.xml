NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. — A controversial art piece that shows Jesus on a dartboard has been removed from a Rutgers University campus library, NJ.com reported. 
NJ.com reports that the piece, titled “Vitruvian Man,” was featured in an art exhibit in the Art Library on Voorhees Mall and showed a figure of a crucified Jesus being stabbed with four darts. 
The piece angered many, who then took to Facebook to demand that it be removed from the exhibit. 
“This is currently displayed in the Art Library on College Ave,” Facebook user Natalie Caruso said in her post on Wednesday. “It is surprising that a state university would allow this. I asked them to take it down because I found it disrespectful and they refused. How is this acceptable!?” 
But not everyone agreed with Caruso. 
“It’s art, it’s an important statement. Also it’s hilarious. We don’t have to cater to the wills of the Church or any denomination of Christianity or religion,” Joe Buchoff, a Rutgers student, wrote on Facebook. 
NJ.com reports that the piece was eventually removed. 
“The artwork in question was removed from the exhibit because it did not meet Rutgers University Libraries policy, which requires art exhibitions and their pieces to be based on university events, curricular offerings and topics of interest to the university community,” Jessica Pellien, director of communications at Rutgers University Libraries, told NJ.com. 
“The process that the libraries use to determine how artwork is selected for inclusion in an exhibit takes into consideration freedom of expression as well as the criteria listed above. We have concluded that the policy and process the libraries use to select artwork for exhibitions was not followed,” Pellien added. 40.486216 -74.451819

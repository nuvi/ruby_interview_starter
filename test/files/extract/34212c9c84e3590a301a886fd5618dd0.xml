UNC gets new Notice of Allegations in NCAA academic case 2016-04-25T14:53:10Z By AARON BEARDAP Sports Writer 
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) - A North Carolina athletics spokesman says the school has received a new document from the NCAA outlining violations connected to UNC&apos;s long-running academic fraud scandal. 
Steve Kirschner says the new Notice of Allegations (NOA) arrived Monday morning, jumpstarting a case that has been stalled in a procedural limbo since August. Kirschner says the school will release it publicly as soon as possible. 
The NCAA first sent an NOA last May, hitting the school with five potential top-level violations that included lack of institutional control. UNC had 90 days to respond, but that process paused in August when the school reported additional information to the NCAA for review. 
UNC took two weeks to redact information to comply with privacy laws before releasing the first one. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

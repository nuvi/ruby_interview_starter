NY natives recovering from Ecuador earthquake injuries ASSOCIATED PRESS PUBLISHED: MONDAY, APRIL 25, 2016 AT 2:00 PM PREV A A 
PLATTSBURGH — Two northern New York natives are recovering from serious injuries suffered in the earthquake that hit Ecuador earlier this month. 
Alan Corliss and Cathy Cooper Corliss were inside their home in Canoa, Ecuador, when the magnitude-7.8 quake struck on the evening of April 16. The 50-year-old Alan and the 49-year-old Cathy were injured when the home collapsed on top of them. 
Patricia Corliss Eames of Woodstock, Vermont, told The Press-Republican of Plattsburgh that her brother told her the couple had no chance to get out of the house. The couple’s 26-year-old daughter was also inside the home but escaped injury. 
The couple is recovering at separate hospitals in Ecuador. 
They met while attending Ticonderoga High School. The two relocated last year to Ecuador from New Hampshire, where they had lived for at least 20 years.

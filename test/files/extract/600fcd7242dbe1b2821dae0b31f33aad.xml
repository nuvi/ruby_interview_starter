The yen was stronger against its rival currencies during Asian trade Monday, with Japanese corporate players moving to pick up the Japanese currency after its rapid depreciation since Friday.
The U.S. dollar weakened to as low as Y111.04 before slightly recovering to Y111.16 at around 0450 GMT. That compared with Y111.80 late Friday in New York.
After touching its three-week high of Y111.90 earlier in the session on hopes that the Bank of Japan might launch extra stimulus measures, the dollar&apos;s upside was weighed down due to selling by Japanese corporate players such as exporters ahead of their book closing at the end of the month. The BOJ&apos;s policy setters are scheduled to meet April 27-28.
&quot;We are seeing correction to excessive move&quot; since Friday, said Yuzo Sakai, manager of FX business promotion at Tokyo Forex &amp; Ueda Harlow.
&quot;But as there still remain hopes for an extra easing by the BOJ, the dollar stopped falling just above Y111 and [remains] directionless,&quot; said Mr. Sakai.
The Japanese currency weakened substantially on Friday due to expectations that the BOJ would ease further later this week. The yen selling gained traction especially because some speculative investors were quickly unwinding their yen-buying positions after building up bullish bets on the Japanese currency to a recent record-high level.
Investors had continued to force up the yen until recently, due to a lack of faith in the BOJ&apos;s negative-rates policy and a belief that the U.S. Federal Reserve will stand pat for some time.
The yen also strengthened against the euro. The common currency fell to Y125.08 from Y125.49 late Friday, while the U.K. pound dropped to Y160.40 from Y161.00.
The Australian dollar declined to Y85.57 from Y86.17.
In other currency-pair trading, the euro was at $1.1243 from $1.1222.
The WSJ Dollar Index, a measure of the dollar against a basket of major currencies, was down 0.15% at 86.61.

DETROIT - Less than one month after charging 14 individuals with scamming millions from the struggling Detroit Public Schools, the federal government has cut deals with nearly all of the defendants, including nine principals, an administrator and a vendor who prosecutors say is at the center of the scheme. 
Among the principals scheduled to plead guilty is Ron Alexander, whose school received a $500,000 Lowes donation from talk show host Ellen DeGeneres. According to court records, Alexander, 60, principal at Charles L. Spain Elementary , is charged with pocketing $23,000 in kickbacks from vendor Norman Shy in exchange for using him as a supplier. His plea hearing is scheduled for May 5 at 10 a.m. The details of his plea agreement are not known. Lowes has announced that it is not taking back its gift and will follow through on its promise to help the school with repairs. 
Shy, 74, of Franklin also has cut a deal in the case. Shy is charged with giving nearly $1 million in kickbacks to principals as a thank you for steering him work. His plea hearing scheduled for May 11 in U.S. District Court. Shy is charged with billing the government $5 million for school supplies that were rarely delivered. Of that $5 million, $2.7 million was ill-gotten, prosecutors allege. 
According to federal prosecutors, plea hearings also have been scheduled for the following: Clara Flowers, 61, of Detroit, an assistant superintendent of DPS’ Office of Specialized Student Services and former principal of Henderson Academy. She is charged with pocketing $324,785 in kickbacks from Shy, who is accused of sneaking the payments to her using different methods, including gift cards and writing checks to contractors who put a new roof on Flowers’ home, painted it and did gutter work. Her plea hearing is scheduled for May 3. Beverly Campbell, 66, of Southfield, a former principal at both Rosa Parks School and Greenfield Union Elementary-Middle School, who is charged with bribery. She is charged with accepting $50,000 in cash kickbacks from Shy, who oftentimes never delivered the goods to her school, got paid anyway with the help of phony invoices signed by Campbell, the government alleges. Her plea hearing is scheduled for May 20. Gerlma Johnson, 56, former principal at Charles Drew Academy, former principal at Earhart Elementary-Middle School and current principal of Marquette-Elementary Middle School, is charged with accepting $22,884 in kickbacks from Shy.

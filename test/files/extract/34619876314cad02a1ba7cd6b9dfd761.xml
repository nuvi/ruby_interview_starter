Linton to dispute bill of cost in libel case; describes matter as ‘political’ Dominica News Online - Monday, April 25th, 2016 at 2:45 PM 
Linton described the matter as political 
Leader of the Opposition, Lennox Linton, said he will dispute a bill of cost in a defamation matter sent to him by attorneys representing Chartered Accountant, Kieron Pinard-Byrne. 

He has described the matter as political. 
On his Facebook page and speaking to the media on Sunday, Linton made his position clear. 
“Mr Kieron Pinard-Byrne has submitted what we call a bill of cost, he’s claiming money. As the respondent, I have the right to react, to disagree,” he stated. 
In a letter dated, April 21, 2016, attorneys for Pinard-Byrne, DeFreitas, DeFreitas and Johnson wrote to Linton demanding $340,926. 39 in the matter which started in the local courts and went all the way to the London-based Privy Council. 
The letter stated that Linton should inform the attorneys no later than the 28th of April if he is in agreement with the costs. 
On his Facebook page, Linton said the costs before the Privy Council are to be assessed by the Cost Clerk of the Privy Council if the if the parties do not agree on costs. 
“The Court of Appeal costs are also to be assessed,” he wrote “I do not agree to the bill of costs presented by Pinard-Byrne and will file my points of dispute. Accordingly, on its completion of its assessment, the court (NOT, DeFreitas, DeFreitas and Johnson) will decide the balance to be paid after the February payment on account of 20,000 pounds.” 
Following a delegate’s conference in Mahaut on Sunday, Linton also spoke on the matter. 
“The court at the level of the Privy Council, in terms of the court’s clerk, will make a judgement on what is the final balance owed to Mr Pinard-Byrne; it’s not DeFreitas, DeFreitas and Johnson or Mr Pinard-Byrne. We await the outcome of that process,” he noted. 
He stated he will comply with the process of the court but is unsure of the April 28 date outlined by the lawyers for Pinard-Byrne. 
” I don’t trust their representations because they’re all political, they’re part of the Labour Party propaganda machine against me. I don’t know why lawyers would get involved in that but that’s what it is. That’s what it is,” Linton remarked.

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton listens during a campaign event April 21 in Hartford, Conn. (Jessica Hill/AP) WILMINGTON, Del. — Hillary Clinton took a swipe at Republican presidential contender Donald Trump for flying into parts of the country on a &quot;big jet,&quot; painting him as an out-of-touch magnate ensconced in his towers bearing his name.
&quot;Donald Trump says wages are too high in America and he doesn’t support raising the minimum wage,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;I have said come out of those towers named for yourself and actually come out and talk and listen to people.
&quot;At some point, if you want to be president of the United States, you’ve got to get familiar with the United States,&quot; she added to laughter from the crowd.
[ Among this group of GOP primary voters, Trump is the Porsche of candidates ] 
The comments — focused on Trump&apos;s economic record — are the newest line of attack for Clinton, who has for months spoken about Trump&apos;s rhetoric. As Clinton moves ever-closer to a general election campaign against Trump, she has signaled that she is likely to focus even more sharply on potentially damaging Trump statements, including his claim during a Republican debate that wages are &quot;too high.&quot; But her comments on Tuesday also criticize Trump for his &quot;country club&quot; and &quot;penthouse&quot; lifestyle.
&quot;You’ve got to spend time with Americans of all sorts and backgrounds — from every part of our country,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;Don’t just fly that big jet in and land it …go make a big speech and insult everyone you can think of and then go back, get on that big jet and go back to your country club house in Florida or your penthouse in New York.
&quot;I kind of don&apos;t think that kind of puts you in touch with what&apos;s going on,&quot; Clinton added. &quot;I have spent now more than a year talking and listening to people.&quot;
She added: &quot;There’s a lot of concern. People are having a hard time. Most Americans have not gotten a raise in 15 years.&quot;
Left unmentioned: Clinton&apos;s Democratic primary opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Sanders remains in the race, but Clinton has in recent days pivoted sharply away from him.
Sanders was left entirely out of Clinton&apos;s usual riff on gun violence — an issue that she has said is one of the most important differences between them.
Instead, Clinton saved her firepower for Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.).
&quot;When you hear Trump and Cruz and the Republicans talking about their economic policies, they want to go back to what failed us before,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;They talk a big game, but if you look at what they’re actually putting out, they want to slash taxes on the wealthy more than they have ever been.&quot;

She is really attacking anyone about a country club lifestyle?nnWhere&apos;d you go to school Hillary?nHow much are you worth?nWhen was the last time you had to &quot;rough it&quot; when there wasn&apos;t enough money?nnPlease spare us the class warfare speech of you attacking Trump.nnIf you want to praise his hard work and how he has made a lot of money, then fine. Hard work should be praised. Don&apos;t come off as some poor &quot;rose up from nothing&quot; person, though.

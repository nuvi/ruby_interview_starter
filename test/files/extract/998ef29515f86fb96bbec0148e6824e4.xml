SEATTLE -- Seattle Public Schools officials say the upcoming viaduct closure could have an impact on almost every school bus in operation. 
While only a handful of routes will likely be directly affected, increased congestion could slow down other bus routes 
&quot;We&apos;re trying really hard to prepare early as best as we can. We are just telling families please be patient,&quot; said Stacy Howard, spokesperson for the district. 
District officials sent notifications to the 54,000 families in the district. 
Howard says nearly half of all drivers will be arriving early to work, to ensure bus stop pick up times remain unaffected. 
If a route changes entirely, Howard says parents can expect a direct phone call or email with details of the re-route or delay.

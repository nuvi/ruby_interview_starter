Mel Brooks is coming to town, and he’s bringing “Blazing Saddles” with him. 
On June 11, the comedy legend will show his 1974 Western comedy classic at the Riverside Theater, 116 W. Wisconsin Ave., and will take part in a Q&amp;A session after the screening. 
Directed and co-written by Brooks, “Blazing Saddles” stars Cleavon Little as an unlikely sheriff in the Old West, standing up against a corrupt land-grabber (Harvey Korman) with help from a drunken ex-gunslinger played by Milwaukee native Gene Wilder and Madeline Kahn as the saloon singer Lili Von Shtupp. Brooks also has cameos as the territory’s dimwitted governor and a Yiddish-spouting Indian chief. | April 25, 2016 5:00 a.m. »Read Full Article Album Review Beyoncé’s ‘Lemonade’ most intimate, accomplished album to date By Piet Levy of the Journal Sentinel 
&quot;Beyoncé&quot; was a game changer for the singer whose name it bears, the moment she went from being a singles-slaying superstar to a bona fide artist, capable of delivering a rich and electrifying body of work. It&apos;s when Queen Bey earned her crown. 
But its larger legacy, at least at the moment, is that it was a game changer for the music industry. &quot;Beyoncé&quot; invented the concept of the &quot;surprise album,&quot; and since that December night in 2013, A-listers from Kendrick Lamar to U2 to Eric Church have also released albums with little to no advance warning. 
That method has come full circle, with Beyoncé dropping her second surprise album, &quot;Lemonade,&quot; on streaming service Tidal Saturday night, complete with an accompanying, nearly track-by-track visual treatment that premiered on HBO. | April 25, 2016 »Read Full Article 17-year-old man shot in front of house 
A 17-year-old man standing in front of a house was shot Sunday evening. 
The victim suffered what police believe was a non-life-threatening wound. The incident happened around 9:45 p.m. in the area of N. 11th St. and W. Locust St. when a suspect fired several shots in the direction of the victim as he stood outside a home. 
The victim was taken to a hospital. | April 24, 2016 This Is Us Filmmaker finds a taste of home in movie about supper clubs By Carol Deptolla of the Journal Sentinel 
Growing up in Oneida just outside Green Bay, Holly L. De Ruyter thought there was nothing distinctive to mark the culture where she grew up; it was just a typical Midwestern town. 
Then De Ruyter, who is now 32, moved to Chicago to go to college and study film. No one went out for fish fry on Fridays, they didn’t understand what she wanted when she asked for a TYME machine, and she couldn’t find a single supper club. 
“It took leaving the state to realize I grew up in a very unique culture,” she said. | April 24, 2016 »Read Full Article Dennis Gall Kaleidoscope’s Gall, 71, turned to law career in later years By Crocker Stephenson of the Journal Sentinel 
Students of Milwaukee’s counterculture, as well as silver-haired hipsters of a certain age, will remember Kaleidoscope, a biweekly alternative paper that, as it neared its final days in the early 1970s, was bought by Dennis Gall. 
The price he paid to take over the publication: $1. 
“At that price, it was a bad deal,” Gall told Milwaukee Sentinel columnist Bill Janz in 1977. | April 24, 2016 »Read Full Article Job growth to get more competitive, regional planners say By Don Behm of the Journal Sentinel 
Job growth in southeastern Wisconsin over the next 35 years will depend on communities in the seven-county region competing directly with other metropolitan areas in the United States for workers, regional planners say. 
For the first time since the post-World War II baby boom generation filled available jobs, and an equal number of women joined men in the labor force, the region’s communities need to play a greater role in attracting workers of all ages for their local employers, according to the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission in Waukesha. 
“If the region does not compete strongly to attract needed workers, economic growth cannot be expected to occur,” the commission says in its draft Vision 2050 plan. | April 24, 2016 »Read Full Article By Meg Jones of the Journal Sentinel 
Two people were shot while riding in a vehicle on Milwaukee’s northwest side Sunday evening. 
The victims were shot by someone in another vehicle who fired several rounds into their car in the 3000 block of W. Good Hope Road around 6:30 p.m. 
The victims, whose names and genders were not released, suffered serious injuries and were taken to a hospital for treatment. | April 24, 2016 Bob McGinn’s Draft Series: Defensive linemen Mississippi’s Robert Nkemdiche flashes talent, but most likely to bust 
Green Bay — Defensive line, annually Exhibit A for first-round draft choices gone bad, has seldom seen a more panned player than Mississippi’s Robert Nkemdiche. For the fifth time in the last 10 years, the Journal Sentinel surveyed a cross-section of NFL personnel people regarding the most likely player to bust among the leading defensive linemen. In 2008, ’10, ’12 and ’13, there was no clear choice on the unlucky soul tabbed for oblivion. With the number of votes cast fairly stable, the largest margin occurred four years ago when Quinton Coples drew 5 1/2 compared to 3 1/2 for both Dontari Poe and Devon Still. It’s possible 25% to 30% of the players selected in the first two rounds could be defensive linemen. “Everybody needs them, everybody wants one,” said a personnel director for an AFC team. “This is obviously the strongest group in the draft.” If this draft had been held on Sept. 20, Nkemdiche might have been a top-5 pick. The night before at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, he created pressure that helped lead to three of Alabama’s five turnovers in the Rebels’ 43-37 victory.“He was sensational that night,” said Phil Savage, the radio analyst for the Crimson Tide radio network and former general manager of the Cleveland Browns. “Alabama, for some reason, decided to run east-west against a very athletic defense and Nkemdiche ate them alive.” Nkemdiche kept penetrating on the backside and chasing down running plays. He also applied consistent pressure on the passer. It represented the high-water mark for Nkemdiche, who registered merely 4 1/2 tackles for loss and 2 1/2 sacks in his other 10 games. What’s worse, he was suspended for the Sugar Bowl after getting drunk at a party in an Atlanta hotel and crashing through a double-pane window before his 15-foot fall was stopped by a bush. Nkemdiche was charged with possession of marijuana because the drug was found in the room. This spring, he admitted to failing a drug test upon reporting for the start of his freshman season in 2013. NFL clubs probably will be making phone calls trying to determine what makes Nkemdiche tick right up until the start of the draft Thursday night. His could be a free-fall, but it only takes one team to believe.“The guy has disaster written all over him,” said one personnel man. “Can play inside and outside. Has initial quickness and can disrupt. Has been an inconsistent flash player.” When the Journal Sentinel polled 17 scouts this month on their choice as the most likely defensive lineman to bust, Nkemdiche was on the wrong end of a landslide vote. He was singled out by 11 of the voters, 10 more than any other player. Receiving one vote apiece were Chris Jones, Emmanuel Ogbah, Jarran Reed, A’Shawn Robinson, Noah Spence and Jihad Ward. The alcohol and the drugs are one thing. The maddening inconsistencies are another. It appears what concerns teams most, however, is the possibility that Nkemdiche won’t commit fully to the rugged regimen of pro football amid his diverse interests. His father, Sunday, is a cardiologist in Mississippi. His mother, Beverly, is a diplomat who spends much of her time working in the politics of Nigeria. Nkemdiche, the No. 1-rated prospect in the United States coming out of a high school near Atlanta, plays tenor saxophone and bass guitar, is interested in the fashion industry and often has an entourage around him.“I don’t know where football comes as a priority,” said one personnel man. “He’s worldly. He’d be a guy you give a big contract to and he’d be happy.” Another scout has watched Nkemdiche’s story unfold since high school.“He’s like a lot of kids from this generation,” the scout said. “He’s grown up in some privilege, and that family is involved with so many different endeavors. You’re not going to get rid of that.“He doesn’t just think football, football, football 24/7. That’s not always the most attractive guy from a football standpoint. Coaches like them a little bit better if it’s football 24/7.“He’s not one of these guys that is spaced out. He is a football kid. He’s just got to get the right people in his ear. You’ve got to find out who’s coming with him wherever he goes ... what his plan is outside of football.” Another lopsided result was evident when the 17 scouts were asked to name the best pass rusher in the draft, regardless of position. Many scouts identified Nkemdiche almost immediately on the No. 1 bust-to-be, but there was considerable deliberation on the No. 1 pass rusher.“It’s a tremendous draft for defensive linemen,” an NFC executive said. “But it’s probably average for pass rushers.” In the end, Ohio State’s Joey Bosa dominated with 12 votes, whereas Shaq Lawson and Spence each had two and Ogbah had one. In the positional polls, scouts were asked to rank their top five players, with five points assigned to first place and so on. No limits were placed on players the scouts could choose from, other than players couldn’t also be voted for in the linebackers poll that will appear Tuesday. Nine scouts represented 3-4 scheme teams and nine represented 4-3 teams. Here were the results: Defensive end in a 3-4: DeForest Buckner, 42 points (eight firsts); A’Shawn Robinson, 27 (one); Jarran Reed, 15; Robert Nkemdiche, 14; Vernon Butler, nine; Jonathan Bullard, seven; Sheldon Rankins, six; Joey Bosa, Chris Jones and Jihad Ward, four; Emmanuel Ogbah, two; and Hassan Ridgeway, one. Nose tackle in a 3-4: Kenny Clark, 32 (one first); Andrew Billings, 28 (three); Austin Johnson, 23 (one); Reed, 19 (three); Rankins, 12 (one); Butler, seven; Maliek Collins and Ridgeway, three; Jones and D.J. Reader, two; and Javon Hargrave, Willie Henry, Quinton Jefferson and Adolphus Washington, one. Defensive end in a 4-3: Bosa, 45 (nine firsts); Shaq Lawson, 27; Buckner, 20; Kevin Dodd, 15; Ogbah, 11; Noah Spence, nine; Shilique Calhoun, three; Leonard Floyd and Carl Nassib, two; and Ward, one. Defensive tackle in a 4-3: Reed, 27 (two firsts); Clark, 21 (one); Buckner (three); Nkemdiche (two) and Rankins (one), 19; Robinson, 11; Billings, nine; Butler, six; and Johnson and Jones, two. | April 24, 2016 Semi drivers help stop runaway pickup I-94 in Kenosha County By Meg Jones of the Journal Sentinel 
Two semitrailer truck drivers helped stop a pickup truck that was careening out of control on I-94 in Kenosha County this weekend after the pickup driver apparently passed out behind the wheel and later was pronounced dead. 
The pickup truck was bouncing off the northbound wall of I-94 around 5:45 a.m. Saturday. Realizing something was wrong, the two semi truck drivers followed behind the pickup to box out other traffic and keep other motorists from harm, according to the Kenosha County Sheriff’s Department. 
When the pickup truck slowed, one of the semi drivers, Rafal Jedlewski, jumped out of his vehicle and ran up to the pickup. He pulled off the door handle but still managed to open the door and stop the pickup by pressing the brake. | April 24, 2016 »Read Full Article By Meg Jones of the Journal Sentinel 
Authorities seized 48 yellow Labrador dogs from a breeding facility in northwestern Wisconsin last week. 
The yellow Labs — 35 adults and 13 puppies — were found Friday in small, filthy travel crates with no access to food or water in the Pierce County community of Elmwood, according to a release from the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department and American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 
Several dead animals were found on the property, and the owner of the facility, Stuart E. West, 68, was booked into jail on suspicion of mistreatment of animals and failing to provide food to confined animals. | April 24, 2016 »Read Full Article Suspect in Potawatomi casino shooting found dead in jail cell By Meg Jones of the Journal Sentinel 
The man police say opened fire in the Potawatomi casino hours after shooting a man in the chest on Milwaukee&apos;s north side was found dead in his jail cell early Sunday. 
Terrill J. Thomas, 38, of Milwaukee was pronounced dead at 1:57 a.m. at the Milwaukee County Jail. There were no visible signs of trauma, according to a Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office news release. 
Thomas was accused of firing a Glock 9 mm handgun in the High Roller area of Potawatomi casino around 3:30 a.m. on April 15. He ordered customers to the floor and began grabbing poker chips before a Milwaukee police officer confronted him and ordered Thomas to drop his weapon, according to court records. | April 24, 2016 »Read Full Article By Bruce Vielmetti of the Journal Sentinel 
A 47-year-old Milwaukee woman survived being shot Saturday in a failed car jacking attempt. 
Police said the shooting happened about 6:30 p.m. in the 2700 block of S. Quincy Ave. As the driver got out of her car, a man with a gun walked up to her and demanded the keys. 
As the woman ran away, the suspect fired one shot which struck the woman, who was treated and released from an area hospital. | April 24, 2016 »Read Full Article Family grieves again, seeks justice after triple homicide By Bruce Vielmetti of the Journal Sentinel 
For the second time this month, hundreds of people filled a Hmong funeral in Milwaukee to mourn one of three people killed in their homes by a man apparently motivated by hatred of those not like himself. 
On Sunday, the crowds remembered Phia Vue, 36, who with his wife, Mai K. Vue, 32, were shot March 6 in the home they shared with their four young children, minutes after police say the same gunman, Dan J. Popp, killed another of his neighbors, Jesus Manso-Perez, 40, in front of his son. 
“We are speeding Phia’s spirit to reunite with his wife and ancestors in the spiritual world,” said Mai Zong Vue, a spokeswoman for the family. | April 24, 2016 »Read Full Article Behind the Headlines How landlords abuse a loophole and details on our transition to Gannett By Katie O&apos;Connell of the Journal Sentinel 
A group of Milwaukee landlords has figured out how to game the system, milking properties for maximum profits while tenants suffer. Reporter Cary Spivak walks us through the investigation he conducted with Kevin Crowe and why their reporting matters. 

And editor in chief George Stanley joins Katie O&apos;Connell to discuss the purchase of the Journal Sentinel by Gannett and what that means for our reporters and our community. | April 24, 2016 »Read Full Article Live updates on Antigo High School prom shooting 
A gunman opened fire outside a prom Saturday night in the northern Wisconsin city of Antigo, shooting two students before being shot by police. The gunman, identified by police as 18-year-old Jakob Wagner, was shot by police and has since died. | April 24, 2016 New colleagues share devotion to in-depth reporting 
Many of you have contacted me with concerns about the April 8 sale of our company to Gannett. It&apos;s understandable that after 133 years of local ownership our readers might worry about us becoming less investigative, less comprehensive, less focused on Milwaukee and Wisconsin. 
After our first series of meetings with our new colleagues, I can assure you of this: 
■If a doctor lets us know babies are suffering permanent harm and dying due to sloppy newborn screening practices, we will still build a team of world-class journalists to let the world know — with an added boost now in distribution from the USA TODAY NETWORK. | April 24, 2016 »Read Full Article

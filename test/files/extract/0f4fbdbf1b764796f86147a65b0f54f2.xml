MELVILLE, N.Y. , April 25, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Henry Schein , Inc. (NASDAQ: HSIC ), the world&apos;s largest provider of health care products and services to office-based dental, animal health and medical practitioners, today announced its continued support of TeamSmile as the non-profit organization launches its 10th year of partnering with sports teams and volunteers to provide free oral health care to children in need. Since its inception in 2006, TeamSmile has provided more than $8 million in dental and preventive services to more than 18,000 children. 
Throughout 2016, nearly 7,000 children are expected to receive free oral health treatment, including preventive care and education, fillings, sealants, and extractions at TeamSmile programs. Children will be welcomed by professional athletes, cheerleaders, and mascots, and receive treatment from volunteer dentists, hygienists, and dental assistants. TeamSmile programs will take place at sports stadiums and practice facilities for a number of teams across the country. 
TeamSmile&apos;s spring/summer roster includes: Kansas City Royals – July 15 Pittsburgh Pirates – July 18 Milwaukee Brewers – August 2 
Additional programs with professional and college sports teams will be scheduled throughout the year. 
In support of the 2016 TeamSmile programs, Henry Schein is donating $50,000 in dental supplies and equipment, as well as transportation of all equipment and materials to and from program sites. The donation is an initiative of Henry Schein Cares, the Company&apos;s global social responsibility program, which has supported TeamSmile since its creation. Henry Schein&apos;s relationship with the organization stems from Team Schein Member Jason Krause, who co-founded the organization with William Busch , DDS, MAGD, North Kansas City Dental Group, and Dustin Colquitt , Pro-Bowl Punter for the Kansas City Chiefs. 
&quot;TeamSmile and Henry Schein have been partners from the start, reflecting a shared commitment to ensuring that children in need have access to quality oral health care,&quot; said Jason Krause , Director of Group Practice, Henry Schein Dental. &quot;Our Company is proud to work with an organization that has found a unique way to inspire, heal, and put smiles on the faces of thousands of children.&quot; 
The co-founders spurred TeamSmile&apos;s growth by working with Henry Schein supplier partners and Team Schein Members to help secure necessary equipment donations and volunteers. &quot;We started TeamSmile not only to provide oral health care to children who may not otherwise be treated, but also to inspire children to take care of their teeth and feel comfortable at the dentist,&quot; said Dr. Busch. &quot;Athletes are like heroes to many children, and we are so grateful to the players who come out to be the role models for a healthy lifestyle, starting with oral health.&quot; 
&quot;I congratulate everyone who has spent these past 10 years working to make oral health care more accessible for children by alleviating both their fears of dental treatment and their families&apos; financial burden,&quot; said Lezlie Doyle , newly appointed Executive Director for TeamSmile. &quot;TeamSmile is grateful to have Henry Schein as a partner that shares our values and makes our mission all the more achievable through its generosity.&quot; 
About TeamSmile TeamSmile is the nation&apos;s premier advocacy group that partners oral health professionals with professional athletic organizations to provide life-changing dental care to underserved children in our communities. By partnering with professional sports organizations, we create an experience that develops bonds between children&apos;s organizations, oral health professionals, surrounding communities, and the athletes that solidify the message that oral health care is vitally important to long-term health. Through this experience, children receive free oral health education, screening, treatment, and are taught that the mouth and body are linked for overall health.

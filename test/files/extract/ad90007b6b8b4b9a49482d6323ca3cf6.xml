By Callum Borchers April 25 at 12:39 PM Follow @callumborchers The Fix&apos;s Chris Cillizza explains why the strategic alliance between Ted Cruz and John Kasich seems destined to fail. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) The stop-Trump deal between Ted Cruz and John Kasich has been described by the New York Daily News as “a remarkable feat of double team trickery.” The Guardian wrote that the Republican presidential front-runner’s rivals have “ganged up” on him.
But a Slate article declared that the pact “makes a lot of sense”; in fact, a headline asked, “Does it go far enough?” And the New York Times’s Upshot blog concluded that “it’s an arrangement that gives the non-Trump candidates a much better chance of denying Mr. Trump the nomination.”
[ Cruz and Kasich devise strategy to keep Trump from clinching three primary states ] 
In the hours since Cruz and Kasich announced what amounts to a non-compete agreement late Sunday in three upcoming primary states, news outlets have mostly characterized the alliance in one of two ways — as underhanded campaign hi-jinks or as strategizing by two desperate candidates whose only hopes of winning the GOP nomination rest on a contested convention. (The Fix has weighed in on the latter end of the spectrum, arguing that the strategy is less sound than it seems and is borne of desperation .)
And whichever way it goes, Trump gets something he can use to his advantage. Coverage that suggests that his opponents are engaging in gamesmanship rather than good-faith competition feeds the Trump narrative about a “ rigged ” political system. At the same time, he can use stories that highlight the logic of the deal to accuse the “ dishonest ” media of being complicit in the collusion.
Both arguments are flawed. The Republican nominating process (and the Democratic one, for that matter) certainly favors an experienced politician who knows the ins and outs of arcane rules, but the outcome is not fixed in advance , as the term &quot;rigged&quot; suggests. If it were, Jeb Bush might be the presumptive nominee at this point. Jeremy Carl makes a sound case for the GOP&apos;s &quot;mix of direct and indirect democracy&quot; in the May 9 issue of the National Review.
And the notion that the media is cheering Cruz and Kasich&apos;s coordination just doesn&apos;t ring true — or, at least, it shouldn&apos;t for anyone paying attention. Reporting that the deal makes sense and could help block Trump from reaching the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination isn&apos;t the same as saying it is the right thing to do; it&apos;s just analysis.
In back-to-back news conferences Monday morning, Cruz and Kasich both faced very tough questions about potentially subverting the will of the people. The persistent inquiries produced responses that could undermine the effectiveness of their agreement. Both candidates emphasized that the decision came down to allocating limited resources. Cruz will focus on Indiana while Kasich will stand down; Kasich will devote his time and energy to Oregon and New Mexico. Neither issued a rallying cry for supporters to get behind the other in the states they were backing out of.
But judging by the skepticism of the questions they faced, reporters weren&apos;t buying the idea that this wasn&apos;t really that big a deal.
Facing a barrage as he picked through his breakfast at a local restaurant, Kasich even said that Indiana Republicans should still vote for him.

Kasich just said Indiana voters should vote for him. He&apos;s just not spending resources in the state. Deal already falling apart?
— Steve Peoples (@sppeoples) April 25, 2016 

Cruz, meanwhile, was peppered with questions, including about what would stop him for changing his mind and competing in Oregon and New Mexico after Kasich gives him a pass in Indiana next week.
Expect the next cycle of reports on the Cruz-Kasich alliance to reflect serious skepticism about whether either candidate is committed enough to actually pull this off and work together to stop Trump. After Monday&apos;s tepid remarks by both candidates, that&apos;s where the story seems headed.
Rest assured, Trump can work with that, too; he can use media accounts to make his rivals look inept and undisciplined in their deviousness. Which is exactly what he just started doing.
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can&apos;t make a deal work.

This is one of Trump&apos;s greatest skills. He can bend almost any story to his advantage. The deal between Cruz and Kasich looks like it could be just another example.

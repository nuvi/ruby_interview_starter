Posted Apr 25, 2016 at 11:45 AM Updated at 11:54 AM If you&apos;re like one of the 45 million Americans who diet each year, you know what makes most diets nearly impossible to stick to: hunger. While dieting can help you lose weight in the short term, most people who go on diets eventually regain most or all of the weight they lost in the first place because they fail to implement the small, lasting habits that keep the weight off once the diet is over. What if there was a way to feel so satisfied and full while eating well that you were never tempted to quit? The great news is, such a way of eating is entirely possible, and even fairly simple. Three components in foods promote satiety, a term describing a fullness that lasts between meals, not just for the 30-60 minutes after eating. Those three items are protein, fat and fiber. Each of them acts in a different way that causes the fullness you feel right after eating to last for several hours. Protein is an essential component for every meal. It helps to stabilize blood sugar, slows down how quickly your stomach empties into the intestine, and helps you to feel full for longer. As a bonus, it also takes a lot of energy for your body to absorb. This means that about 20-30 percent of the calories you get from eating protein-rich food like chicken goes towards digesting it, and you only end up absorbing a net amount of about 70-80 percent of the calories in that food. Good protein choices include: lean meats

Leeds United are chasing Paderborn midfielder Marvin Bakalorz - and extra financial clout could beat off the competition. 
After an impressive season for Paderborn in Bundesliga II, the 26-year-old is a wanted man and looked to be on the verge of joining Bundesliga outfit Hannover. 
But according to Bild , that deal could be in danger of falling through due to the extra money on offer at Leeds. 
And Bakalorz reportedly has a £780,000 release clause in his contract. 
There is a &quot;strong chance&quot; that former Huddersfield Town manager Neil Warnock will still be Rotherham boss next season, says Chairman Tony Stewart. 
Neil Warnock has been a hit at Rotherham United 
The 67-year-old arrived at the New York Stadium in February with the club six points from safety, but they have now confirmed their Championship status with two games to spare. 
&quot;I think it&apos;s dotting the i&apos;s and crossing the t&apos;s, and we&apos;ll sail through that,&quot; Stewart said. 
&quot;We&apos;re in serious talks, and I think that we&apos;ll develop the talks, and I think there&apos;s a strong chance that Neil will be with us next season. 
&quot;He has enjoyed the stay with us - I think he wants to stay with us, and we want to stay with him.&quot; 
Championship newbies Aston Villa have been heavily linked with Nigel Pearson as their next manager - but he&apos;s reportedly been asked to delay his decision by Middlesbrough .

The Birmingham Mail reports that the former Leicester City man is a possible target for Boro, with Aitor Karanka&apos;s exit on the cards should he fail to guide the Riverside outfit to promotion. 
Burnley could find out this week how much compensation they are due from Liverpool over the capture of Danny Ings. 
The striker left Turf Moor for Anfield last summer after his contract expired, but because he is under 24 the Clarets are due compensation. 
And the club are hoping for a record fee for a player they value in the region of £10m .

A tribunal is due to meet in Manchester on Tuesday to consider the evidence, but they could inform the two sides of their decision at a later date. 
No truth to the rumours that Arsenal were interested in Fulham &apos;s Kostas Mitroglou. 
The striker is on loan at Benfica, and expects to complete a permanent move in the summer. 
And although several Portuguese sources claimed the Gunners were tracking him, Goal reports that they are wide of the mark. 
Bolton youngster Zach Clough intends to stay beyond the summer, despite relegation to League One. 
The 21-year-old, who is the club&apos;s top scorer, may have to make a decision, with several clubs believed to be tracking him. 
“I don’t know what will happen if a bid comes in and the club accepts it,” he told The Bolton News .

“Then I will have to make a decision but at this moment there have been no bids and I am still a Bolton player and I want to be here in League One and play for Bolton.” 
Danny Graham wants to make his Blackburn Rovers move permanent. 
The striker arrived on loan from Sunderland, and is due to leave the Stadium of Light this summer when his contract expires. 
But although he wants to stay at Rovers, talks over a deal have apparently gone quiet. 
Another player happy where is - QPR midfielder Sandro, who is on loan at West Brom. 
The Brazilian has made 10 appearances since moving to the Hawthorns in January, 
&quot;I think he&apos;d love to stay,&quot; Baggies boss Tony Pulis said. 
&quot;He enjoys the dressing room and has mixed in well.&quot;

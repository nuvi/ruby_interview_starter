Renault reveals new Koleos in Beijing Renault reveals new Koleos in Beijing 
The crossover line-up of the French car maker welcomes a third family member, that sits above the compact Captur and the midsize Kadjar. Technically speaking, the Koleos is based on the Nissan X-Trail, visually it mimics the Megane and Talisman. 
The name of Renault’s big crossover may be deceiving, as the previous carrier of the Koleos moniker was kind of a SUV-fied Scenic – which reincarnated last year as the Kadjar. The new Koleos is much longer and takes on the likes of the Hyundai (Grand) Santa Fe and the Kia Sorento. Unlike the latter two, the Koleos is not a seven-seater – for now. 
The interior is not unfamiliar, with its large tablet-style touchscreen and R-Link 2 infotainment system. Renault claims a boot space of 624 litres with the back seats in place and even 1,690 litres with the seats folded. The Koleos owes its mechanical architecture to the Nissan X-Trail, including selectable all-wheel drive on some versions. 
Renault says the Koleos is ‘destined for a global audience’. It will be assembled in Wuhan for China and in Busan, South Korea for the rest of the world. Europe has to wait to 2017 to see the first units arrive at the dealers.

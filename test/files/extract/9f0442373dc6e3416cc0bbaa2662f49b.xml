BANGKOK--Thailand posted a trade surplus in March as exports continued rising for a second straight month but officials sounded a note of caution about the outlook for overseas shipments.
The Commerce Ministry said Monday the country recorded a $2.96 billion trade surplus last month, down from the $4.98 billion surplus posted in February.
Exports increased 1.3% in March from a year ago to $19.12 billion, compared with a 10.3% increase in the preceding month.
Somkiat Triratpan, director of the ministry&apos;s Trade and Strategy Bureau, said at a news conference that the latest rise in exports was largely fueled by continued growth in shipments of gold, machinery and automotive products, among others.
Deputy Commerce Minister Suvit Maesincee, however, said there was still uncertainty over whether Thailand&apos;s export growth momentum would continue against a backdrop of unstable global economic recovery.
According to the data, industrial exports, which account for 80.4% of the country&apos;s total exports, rose 3.4% year-over-year in March. They were led by a 43.8% gain in shipments of jewelry and accessories as well as a 1.7% rise in automotive exports.
In the first quarter of 2016, Thai exports grew 0.9% year-over-year to $53.83 billion.
The customs data also showed imports fell 6.9% in March from a year earlier to $16.16 billion, slowing from a 16.8% decline in February.
For the first three months of this year, Thailand&apos;s imports contracted 12% year-over-year to $45.64 billion.
Charnon Boonnuch, an economist at TISCO Financial Group, which had projected a 6.0% fall in exports for March, said that the stronger-than-expected exports were likely to buoy Thailand&apos;s first-quarter gross domestic product, helping offset a slowdown in domestic demand.
&quot;However, export outlook remains weak, as a surprising gain in 1Q16 was driven mainly by gold exports and military vehicles. Excluding these items, exports fell around -4% in the first quarter,&quot; said Mr. Charnon. &quot;Since we expect gold shipments to slow in April, overall exports might turn red again. Therefore, we still maintain our view on -2.0% export contraction in 2016.&quot;
Despite recent downgrades of 2016 export growth targets by various agencies, the Commerce Ministry maintained its export growth projection at 5.0%. The Bank of Thailand has projected overseas shipment value will contract 2% this year.

News With just two weeks until its release, here&apos;s Uncharted 4&apos;s final trailer. 
Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End is scheduled to release on May 10, and with just two weeks left until its release, Sony and Naughty Dog have released the title’s final trailer. 
The final trailer for Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End highlights Nathan Drake’s continued battle between whether or not he should help his brother, Sam, as he promised himself he would end his career a long time ago. Unfortunately for him, it appears all of his fighting is for naught as several segments in the latter part of the trailer show him doing what he does best in Uncharted 4. 
Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End will launch exclusively on PlayStation 4 on May 10. Daniel Perez Senior Editor

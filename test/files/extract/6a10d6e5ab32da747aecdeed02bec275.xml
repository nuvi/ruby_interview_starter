As reported by Neowin , Microsoft is now offering a buy-one, get-one free deal at the Microsoft Store: If you buy a Lumia 950XL unlocked phone for the full retail price of $649, you’ll also receive a free unlocked Lumia 950 (value: $549), according to the webpage. The deal expires on May 1, or until supplies deplete, according to Microsoft.

As a debate raged over the appointment, BJP MP and yesteryear actress Hema Malini supported the decision of the Indian Olympic Association(IOA), saying Salman&apos;s popularity is being utilised for a good cause. However, another BJP leader and Haryana Health and Sports Minister Anil Vij disapproved of the decision. Vij said &quot;filmy hero&quot; will not bring medals for the country. Batting legend Sunil Gavaskar saw nothing wrong in Salman&apos;s appointment as Indian contingent&apos;s brand ambassador for the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. &quot;Why not?&quot;, he asked in response to a query on the matter. Union Minister of State for Sports Sarbananda Sonowal said sentiments of sportspersons who are opposed to Salman&apos;s appointment has been conveyed to the IOA. At the same time, the ministry encourages prominent figures from different walks of life to encougrage sports in the country,he said. &quot;People love him so much. So if he is the brand ambassador, what is the problem,&quot; Hema told reporters when asked to comment on Salman&apos;s appointment. Asked about his alleged involvement in the hit-and-run case in Mumbai, she said that episode was a &quot;section of his life...his popularity has to be utilised for a good cause.&quot; Salim took to Twitter to support his son, who plays a wrestler in his upcoming film &quot;Sultan&quot;, while also taking potshots at Milkha Singh. &quot;Salman Khan may not have competed but is an A level swimmer cyclist and weight lifter.. Sportsmen are performing because of sports lovers like us,&quot; Salim, 80, wrote. 50-year-old Khan&apos;s appointment has been criticised by some top sportspersons, including star wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt and sprint legend Milkha Singh who have questioned IOA&apos;s decision to go with the superstar over a sportsperson. Milkha, whose life was turned into a blockbuster film &quot;Bhaag Milkha Bhaag&quot;, had said that sports personalities like PT Usha should have been considered by IOA instead of importing &quot;a person from Bollywood.&quot; Reacting to this Salim said, &quot;Milkhaji it is not Bollywood, it is the Indian Film Industry and that too the largest in the world. &quot;The same industry which resurrected you from fading away in oblivion.&quot; Vij said wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt should have been made the brand ambassador. In a tweet, Vij said &quot;Yogeshwar Dutt forget Salman Khan. You are a real hero, Salman is a filmy hero. Real heroes, not filmy hero will bring medals for the country.&quot; Recently Yogeshwar Dutt, an Olympic medalist, had said in social media that the appointment of Salman was not a good decision. Vij was of the view that IOA should have appointed some renowned Indian sportsman. Yogeshwar Dutt has brought many laurels for the country in wrestling, he said.

Collective hearts melted when photos emerged on Friday of Prince George meeting President Barack Obama. The 2-year-old was granted an extension on his bedtime to meet the world leader and he did so wearing his pajamas and a bath robe, ready to hit the hay moments after performing his royal duties. Just as the Little Prince was well-received by the Obamas, his robe was a hit as well. As it turns out, Prince George, just like his mother the Duchess of Cambridge, is quite a trendsetter. Within minutes of being identified, his robe sold out online.
Prince George greets Barack Obama in a robe. More The retailer of the robe, My 1st Years , took to Facebook to share their excitement over the shopping frenzy. “We can’t believe Prince George wore our robe to meet President Obama! Doesn’t he look adorable?!” the company wrote. “You guys have gone crazy for it &amp; it’s already sold out.”
Thanks to the “Prince George Effect,” the toddler fashion brand is accepting pre-orders for those that missed the mark the first time around. “Fit for a prince!” the company’s website notes of the personalized, luxury white bathrobe with blue patterned trim that sells for approximately $39.

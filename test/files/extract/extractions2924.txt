Shannon Furey of Saugus chosen as Epic Service Warrior Comment Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 8:00 AM By Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 8:00 AM SAUGUS Shannon Furey will graduate from Saugus High School in June, but she’s not done learning yet. Furey, 21, was recently selected to be one of 24 youth with disabilities from Greater Boston that will participate in a yearlong community service and education program called Epic Service Warriors. Furey and SHS junior Pranaav Murdaliharan are the first Saugus students to be selected for the Epic Service Warrior program, an honor that Executive Director of Pupil Personnel Services and Special Education Lisa Howard said is an important milestone for the students and Saugus’ special education program. “It speaks to our commitment to really getting our young adults ready to transition to the world of work and secondary education and the importance of recognizing the strength and talent that a young adult like Shannon has to offer the community,” Howard said. Epic Executive Director Jeff Lafata said Furey was chosen for the competitive program because of her altruistic spirit and her potential to spark progress, both in others and herself. “Shannon, like all of the youth that we pick, has a motivation and a desire to do community service and to help other people,” Lafata said. “But really, she is able to look beyond the one-day service project and realize that, through service, not only is she making a difference, but she’s learning skills to help her get a job.” As an Epic Service Warrior, Furey will participate in a minimum of 12 community service projects over the course of a year. The group will work on everything from cleaning parks to painting school buildings to helping the homeless. Lafata said that every service day is focused on preparing participants for independent living and employment. “If we’re working in a kitchen preparing meals, we’ve had youth who, after doing that have gone onto culinary programs because they realize this is what they want to do,” Lafata said. “Even for those who hate cooking, it’s getting them to realize that if you want to live on your own, you have to cook for yourself.” In addition to the service days, Furey and the other Epic Service Warriors will take part in a minimum of 10 leadership development days that will educate them on topics including disability history, political literacy and employment readiness. “Our hope is that with the leadership workshops and the service days paired together that they’re learning the skills that they need to be strong self-advocates for themselves,” Lafata said. “If you can be an advocate for yourself and show people what you’re able to do, it completely changes the potential for employment and independent living and what you’re going to do in your life.” Page 2 of 3 - As Furey prepares to leave the structured, sheltered and familiar environment of Saugus High, it’s important that she has the tools to use her own voice to navigate the world, Lafata said. “The biggest thing I see with young people who are hitting 22 and leaving the school setting is that they have this Individual Education Plan where everyone already knows their accommodations,” Lafata said. “So then they leave, whether it’s going into employment or high education, they don’t ask for these accommodations because they don’t know they need them. That’s one thing we work on.” Howard said that Saugus is working to create partnerships with transition programs like Triangle and Epic so that students in special education are prepared with the skills and resources to enter the world. “If somebody is not preparing them for the next step and getting them ready to be able to advocate for themselves, they are like a deer caught in the headlights,” Howard said. “School is very comfortable. We are the kindest, most tolerable people in the world, and then we’re gone. We want our young adults to be ready to handle that transition and know how to access resources.” Learning to be a self-advocate Lafata said that learning to be a self-advocate has reliably improved Epic Service Warriors’ prospects for the future. Since the program’s founding, 90 percent of graduates are either employed or enrolled in higher education, Lafata said. Eighty-nine percent have retained their job for longer than a year. For people with disabilities, achieving employment is no small feat. According to Epic’s numbers, the unemployment rate for people with a disability is approximately double that of people without a disability. Community service can be a game changer when it comes to getting a job, Lafata said. Youth who volunteer are 19 percent more likely to graduate college and 27 percent more likely to find employment. For Furey, joining the Epic Service Warriors will build on a strong foundation of independent living skills that began in Saugus and at the newly formed partnership with the School to Career class at Triangle in Malden. Leanna Walsh has taught Furey in the 18 to 22 transition classroom at Saugus High School for the past year. Walsh has no doubt that Furey will thrive as an Epic Service Warrior. “She’s got great enthusiasm and she is very eager to be helpful, to be a leader,” Walsh said. “All she wants is independence and success and to be an inspiration to others.” Page 3 of 3 - Though Furey said she hopes to gain job experience and opportunities from the Epic Service Warriors program, her ultimate goal is more selfless. “Helping people, helping the town, helping the community,” Furey said. Furey’s community will miss her deeply when she moves on from Saugus High to the Epic Service Warriors program. “At Saugus High and the town in general, she is known as the mayor,” Walsh said. “The girl just knows everybody.” Though Walsh said she hasn’t seen much anxiety from Furey in the final stretch at Saugus High, Furey is percolating in the typical melting pot of emotion that leaving high school stirs. “I’m excited and sad and nervous,” Furey said with a smile. “All of those things.” Howard said Furey’s acceptance to the Epic Service Warrior program will be an inspiration to other Saugus students. “Being part of the Warrior program, Shannon proves that everyone has a talent,” Howard said. “She is a major success story. She’s going to be someone. She’s going to give back to young adults who are taking the next step into a scary world. That speaks volumes about her. She’s like a county music song in the making.” Walsh thinks Furey’s experience in the program will lead her back to Saugus. “I can definitely see Shannon in some kind of ambassador role,” Walsh said. “I don’t think she’ll ever lose her Saugus ties.” But for now, Furey is working on expanding her horizons. Last weekend, she participated in orientation day for the 2016 Epic Service Warriors. When asked how she was advised to prepare, Furey said, “Just bring your smiling self.” By

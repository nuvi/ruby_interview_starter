A STATUE of St Margaret Clitherow will be carried in a procession through the streets of York city centre next Saturday. 
The procession will be part of a pilgrimage in honour of the Saint and the Martyrs of York and will begin with a Solemn Mass in the traditional form at St Wilfrid&apos;s Church in Duncombe Place at 1.30pm. 
The procession will follow at about 3pm, passing through Shambles, where there is a shrine to Margaret Clitherow and over Ouse Bridge, and the day will conclude at around 4pm back at St Wilfrid&apos;s Church.

The pilgrimage, organised by the Latin Mass Society, is expected to attract visitors from all over the country. 
Margaret Clitherow was pressed to death in the city in 1586 after it was discovered that she had been sheltering priests at her home in Shambles. Share:

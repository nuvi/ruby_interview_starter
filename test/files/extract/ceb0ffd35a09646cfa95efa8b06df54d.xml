DENVER magicJack VocalTec Ltd. (&quot;magicJack&quot;), a leading VoIP cloud-based communications company, announced its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of North American Telecommunications Corporation d/b/a Broadsmart (&quot;Broadsmart&quot;), a leading hosted UCaaS provider for medium-to-large multi-location enterprise customers. The purchase price for the acquisition is $40 million , consisting of $38 million in cash and $2 million in ordinary shares of magicJack. There is also a $2 million earnout tied to the achievement of 2016 revenues.
Broadsmart has a track record of designing, provisioning and delivering complex Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) solutions to blue chip corporate customers on a nationwide basis. It has expertise in servicing enterprises with hundreds to thousands of locations. The business is highly profitable, having generated approximately $13 million in revenues and $4.6 million of EBITDA in 2015, an EBITDA margin of over 35%. For 2016, Broadsmart is forecasting over 20% year-over-year growth in sales.
The two founders of Broadsmart, Todd Correll and Tom Tharrington, will remain with the business as CEO and President, respectively, of Broadsmart Global, Inc., a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of magicJack VocalTec, Ltd.
The acquisition brings together an optimal mix of resources and capabilities across the two firms. magicJack acquired Broadsmart to diversify beyond its core business into UCaaS, targeting high end SMB and enterprise customers, and to realize synergies by leveraging magicJack&apos;s proprietary low cost infrastructure. Broadsmart will benefit from magicJack resources to deliver additional managed services and solutions to its customers and channel partners.
Q Advisors, a leading global TMT investment banking boutique, acted as exclusive financial advisor to Broadsmart in connection with the transaction.
Todd Correll , co-founder and CEO of Broadsmart said, &quot;We met the Q Advisors team late last year. After an hour conversation with the team, it was clear that they had a great command of the managed services sector and the relevant players. They listened to our objectives, established the sale price we could expect and identified a projected buyer quickly. It was a true testament to the experience necessary in an M&amp;A transaction. Q Advisors&apos; deep team worked with us hand-in-hand on an accelerated basis to get Broadsmart an industry-leading exit multiple from a partner that we are excited to be working with as part of their senior management team. We look forward to working with Q Advisors in the future.&quot;

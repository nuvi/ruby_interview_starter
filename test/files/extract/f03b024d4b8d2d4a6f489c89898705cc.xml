Evicted Southern California centenarian gets new home Posted: Updated: 
LA QUINTA, Calif. (AP) - A 100-year-old woman evicted from her apartment has a new home in the Southern California desert after a newspaper reported on her plight and motivational speaker Tony Robbins and a local congressman joined in helping her. 
The Desert Sun newspaper ( http://desert.sn/1WiZBWQ ) says on April 1 Evelyn Heller lost a trial in which her Palm Desert landlord sought her eviction on grounds she had loud, disruptive arguments with one of her daughters. 
When the story ran, Robbins and U.S. Rep. Raul Ruiz contacted the newspaper, which put them in touch with each other. 
Ruiz sent social workers to help Heller find a new apartment and Robbins donated $24,000 - $1,000 a month for two years. 
She now lives in La Quinta, where Ruiz, his wife, and Robbins visited her Friday.

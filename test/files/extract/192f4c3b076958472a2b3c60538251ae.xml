Former North Cestrian Grammar pupil completes epic South American cycle ride for Help for Heroes Share: 0 comments 
A FORMER pupil at Altrincham&apos;s North Cestrian Grammar and two pals have completed an epic 8,000 cycle ride along the length of South America - and their efforts will boost the services&apos; charity, Help for Heroes. 
Henry Jeffers, aged 22, and two friends, Morgan Bywater and Nathan Bell, rode the length of South America, completely unsupported, over six months. 
The &apos;Pedalling Patagonia and Beyond&apos; team set out in October from Ushuaia, Argentina, at the southern tip of South America. 
They followed the Andes Trail running along the West Coast of the South American continent passing through Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and finally Colombia. 
Northern Moor resident Henry is currently serving with the Army reserves, the 4th Battalion the Parachute Regiment. He will go to Sandhurst to become a commissioned officer in September. 
Nathan is an Army physical training instructor and Morgan is a commissioned officer who will also become a regular in September. 
The challenge involved crossing deserts, mountains and jungle in all kinds of arduous conditions. 
The expedition was completely self-funded and unsupported as they carried everything they needed to reach the finish line. 
All donations are going to the charity: Help for Heroe via www.justgiving.com/SouthAmerica Share:

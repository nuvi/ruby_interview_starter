11 candidates on ballots for three council seats Posted: April 23, 2016 - 8:48pm | Updated: April 24, 2016 - 12:06am By MATT DOTRAY A-J MEDIA 
Three contested Lubbock City Council races, along with an open race for mayor, means there could be a majority of new faces leading the city after the May 7 municipal election. 
The race for District 4 features the only incumbent, as Mayor Pro Tem Jim Gerlt faces Steve Massengale, former school board president and business owner. 
Massengale has talked a lot about taxes during his campaign, and he said he’d push for the city to achieve its goals through innovation, not taxation. He also said he’d work to improve the city’s communication and response, especially as it relates to the growing population in the South-Central Lubbock district. 
Gerlt, who’s represented the district since 2012, is running on his experience in hopes of winning a second term. He said his goal when first running for office was to level out the city’s more than $1 billion debt, come up with a less burdensome way to finance city government and to plan for the future. He said he’s reached those goals, and is looking to continue that work. 
In North Lubbock&apos;s District 1 there are four candidates vying for the seat being vacated by Victor Hernandez as he runs for mayor: Juan Chadis, a retired safety coordinator and environmental technician, Frank Gutierrez, a retired customer service manager, Texas Tech student Tristan Ramirez and Ben Medina, a patient support representative. 
Gutierrez is the only candidate to have run for the seat before, losing by a little more than 150 votes in the last election. 
The candidates are all running on what they say are the needs of their district. 
Chadis said he intends to focus on the high crime rate, working to get police substations in the area. Gutierrez’s big issue is also public safety, saying during A-J Media&apos;s municipal candidates debate April 11 that more minorities in the police department and more visibility from police would increase safety. 
Medina’s focus has been on downtown development, saying the homeless issue needs to be addressed and the city needs to make incentives for businesses to move there. Ramirez said he wants to bring the same investment and maintenance of infrastructure to District 1 that’s happening elsewhere, and find a solution for the disparity in the amount of code enforcement in his district, especially around the college campus. 
There are five candidates looking to fill the seat Floyd Price has held since 2004 in District 2. Price opted against running for a fourth term. 
The candidates are retired assistant administrator Gordon Harris, Attorney Jared Hall, Pastor Christopher Moore, business owner Tiger Pratt and Shelia Patterson Harris, a retired juvenile probation officer and supervisor. 
Development of East Lubbock is the top issue in this race. 
Harris’ focus has been on the 2004 North and East Lubbock Master Development Plan, which he said he wants to implement if elected. 
Pratt said his plan for economic development would involve partnerships with public and private organizations, and to see tax dollars in all districts reinvested back into them. 
Patterson Harris said there’s a failed relationship between the city and the citizens in District 2 right now, and she’d like to see more communication along with revitalization in the area that’s equal to other parts of the city. 
Moore said he’d also like to promote the 2004 Master Plan, and see more emphasis on education and employment in East Lubbock. 
Hall has been getting the backing of the conservative group in Lubbock, and has promoted himself as the conservative in the race. Hall said the city needs to provide basic services in the area, like more police patrols and keeping up with roads. He’s expressed his concerns over the city’s debt and hidden fees, two things he said he’d look to limit.

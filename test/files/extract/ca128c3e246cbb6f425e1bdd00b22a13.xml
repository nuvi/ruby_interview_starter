Incoming: Arabian Nights: The Desolate One SHARE ON: Rob Aldam — April 25, 2016 
The latest from Miguel Gomes (Tabu, Our Beloved Month of August) Arabian Nights (As mil e uma noites) is probably this year’s most ambitious cinematic undertaking, and the most talked about film experience of the last Cannes Film Festival. Arabian Nights uses the framing device from the original Arabian Nights of the beautiful young Scheherazade telling tale after tale in order to keep her murderous husband from killing her—but that’s where the similarities end. Over three features, Gomes channels the current struggles of economically depressed Portugal through an assortment of tales that range from farcical yarns to grounded accounts of social issues. 
Volume 2 – The Desolate One: The volume’s opening chapter is about a criminal on the run. In “The Tears of the Judge,” a public trial becomes a mockery, with the testimony implicating everyone in attendance. Finally, The Desolate One ends on an exhilarating note, with a hugely entertaining story about a dog named Dixie who’s passed between owners, familiarizing us with the inhabitants of a working-class apartment building. – See more at: http://www.newwavefilms.co.uk/view-film-detail.html?viewListing=MTM2&amp;cat=1#sthash.0Lp4Hj6U.dpuf Arabian Nights: The Desolate One is out in cinemas on Friday.

Despite an enjoyable early life of surfing and stealing hats, Rob was ostracised due to his height. In a concerted attempt to fit-in he moved to Africa to live with Giraffes in Botswana. He&apos;s piteous luck continued when he was ambushed just south of Zambia by angry faeces throwing Baboons. He fled to Sheffield and now lives in a treehouse in his soul.

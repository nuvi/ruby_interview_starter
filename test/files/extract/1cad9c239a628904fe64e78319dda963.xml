Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 1:51 PM Updated at 1:51 PM More Content Now Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 1:51 PM It is ever amazing to this writer how one needs to make great plans and spend large sums to reach the far ends of the world, and even a trip, say to Florida, takes no small change and requires some effort — including deciding if you are flying, driving or walking. In this age of mobility, we do just that far more than our forefathers would have dreamed, though the Earth remains a pretty big place despite our claims it is a “small world.” Yet, tonight if the sky is clear you have the ability to look billions upon billions of light years, far, far into the Universe. With a modest, portable telescope you can locate incredibly distant galaxies, each at least as grand as our own Milky Way, and this is the best part — you can do this without even stepping off your porch. Unless of course your porch is under the glare of neighborhood lights. It’s also amazing how just one unshielded security light, neon sign or street lamp can cut you off from the vast fields of stars spread across the night sky. This cosmic adventure awaits you every clear night. Without even a telescope or spending a penny, you can feel you have transported across the fantastic spans of space. Yet the sky is not “there” and you are “here.” Through all this, we realize we are very much a part of the Grand Plan, traveling our wonderful speck of dust we call the Earth, an integral part of the rotating, revolving cosmos. OR you can catch what’s on the tube — that means TV to us modern flat-screen television lovers without a cathode ray tube on the back of the screen. You can pass time surfing the Web. Better yet, the show above your head outside can have much more to offer and carries no monthly fee. Even without a telescope you can trace the constellations, learn the names of the stars making them up, track a few variable stars as they slowly go up and down in brightness, watch for meteors and even the rare display of Northern Lights. Binoculars will catapult you into the cosmos, showing vastly more riches. Even a fairly small telescope on a steady tripod can show you the fantastic rings of Saturn, bright moons of Jupiter, the Moon’s rugged face and spectacular star clusters and a few fuzzy spots including galaxies and nebulous wisps. Larger telescopes can show you even more. This is only the beginning of what awaits you on this great adventure under the stars - again without necessarily even leaving your yard. Resources such as Sky and Telescope (http://www.skyandtelescope.com) and Astronomy (www.astronomy.com) magazines and their respective web sites are two great places to guide you in this hobby. Page 2 of 2 - Jupiter is the extremely bright evening “star” high in the south. Last quarter Moon is on Friday, April 29.

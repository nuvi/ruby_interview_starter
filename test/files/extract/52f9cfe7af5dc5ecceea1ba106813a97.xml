By Natalie Burg To hear some politicians talk about the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the healthcare law was the death knell of full-time employment in the United States . By requiring qualifying organizations to provide healthcare coverage for full-time employees — and by setting the threshold for full-time work at 30 hours per week — the law was predicted to incent employers to keep as many employees as possible at or below 30 hours to avoid the cost of offering insurance. Now that the regulations are in place, however, employment trends are showing more optimistic results. According to the ADP Research Institute ® report Measuring the Impact of the Affordable Care Act , there was little to no change in the percentage of workers in any employment category during 2013 and 2014, a conclusion also supported by a recent academic study . That ’ s good news for American workers and the recovering economy. However, although the new law may not be affecting overall hiring outcomes, it is affecting the way employers think about and make hiring decisions on a day-to-day basis. The requirement that eligible employers offer affordable healthcare to employees working 30 hours or more has not only changed the definition of full-time work for many employers, but it has also made the decision to hire such employees more complicated. More Demanding Justification For Hiring Raghu Vir can certainly vouch for how complex the ACA has made his hiring decisions. Vir is the owner and president of Saince , a small clinical documentation company in Georgia. Although he isn ’ t letting the healthcare requirements get in the way of Saince ’ s growth, he and his HR department have serious discussions when it comes to justifying a full-time hire. “ The dynamics of hiring, for us at least, have changed, ” said Vir. “ When there is a position to fill, there is a lot more homework that we need to do internally. ” For example, when hiring managers want to fill a position, they not only need to convince HR that the position is justified , but they also have to judge whether the position should be full- or part-time. “ And, primarily, ” Vir said, “ that decision is driven not by the volume of work but ... by how it will affect healthcare compliance. ” Things get even more complicated when Saince approaches one of the new employment tiers the ACA has established — such as 50-plus employees or 100-plus employees. The company currently employs about 60 full-time employees and between 25 and 30 part-time workers. “ We had to really think hard before we went over 50 full-time employees last year ” given compliance costs, said Vir. “ But we went over that anyway because of business reasons. ” Were Saince to go over 100 full-time employees, it would face a new set of rules, forcing Vir “ to think hard and deep ” about growth. “ Will we stop hiring? I don ’ t think so. But do we think twice before hiring? Definitely yes, ” Vir said. When Lines Between Full- and Part-Time Are Blurred The ACA requirements are uniquely challenging for industries that have employment practices that don ’ t fit neatly into the new law ’ s provisions. Although the law draws clean and clear lines between full- and part-time workers, traditional employment practices in industries such as home healthcare, for example, do not. Based on the needs of their clients, home health workers often vary between full- and part-time work on a month-to-month or even week-to-week basis. “ It fluctuates greatly, ” said Lenny Verkhoglaz, CEO of home healthcare franchis ing company Executive Care . “ So keeping track of our employees ’ time becomes challenging. ” The ACA requires Executive Care to offer healthcare options to full-time employees, but to do so company representatives have to perform certain tasks. First, they must keep track of which workers qualify as full-time during a measurement period of three to 12 months. Then, employees who qualify as full-time based on that period must be offered health coverage for a stability period of no less than six months. Then the entire cycle repeats itself. It ’ s a complicated process, and it can be difficult to know whether you are doing exactly what you need to be doing, according to Verkhoglaz. “ To be very honest, nobody knows, ” he said. “ I ’ ve done a lot of research, and it ’ s such a muddy picture that I can ’ t get a correct answer f rom anyone. ” Nevertheless, the organization continues to hire. “ We ’ re a growing industry, ” said Verkhoglaz. “ We will continue complying with the ACA regulations. We have no choice. We cannot cut our employees down to 29 hours. It ’ s not realistic. ” Verkhoglaz ’ s and Vir ’ s experiences are telling: In an employment study, neither would appear to have changed hiring practices because of the ACA. They both continue to hire full- and part-time employees as needed. And, of course, some employers have always offered their employees health benefits, regardless of their size or the legal requirements, simply as a way to build relationships with their employees and retain talent. They would certainly increase the number of businesses unaffected by the new law. But the new healthcare law has undoubtedly complicated hiring decisions. So, although the ACA may not be changing hiring outcomes — clearly good news — for those businesses that are new to offering their employees coverage, it is certainly affecting the process of hiring and the management of full- and part-time employees in a new way.  Visit adp.com/spark for more workforce management news, stories and tips.

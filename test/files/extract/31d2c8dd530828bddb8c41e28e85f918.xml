Doesn&apos;t answer your question, but I remember many years ago they had a playoff between the third-bottom team in the prem league vs. the third team in the championship. The theory was that the third-bottom team still had a chance to stay up if they were better than the third-placed team from the league below. Not sure how long that arrangement lasted.
To your point, I think that the playoffs make FEWER games academic. Mid-table teams can be in with a shout for 6th place until very late in the season. And for those who sit in places 3-6 there is a seeding advantage if you come third so they are also fighting. PLUS it helps teams who make a bad start but then get their sh*t together. PLUS it makes a great occasion for those teams (and their fans) in the playoffs.

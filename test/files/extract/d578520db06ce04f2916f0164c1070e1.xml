UPDATE: 12.20pm 
It has been confirmed that BHS has filed for administration, putting its 164 shops, including one in Newport and around 11,000 jobs at risk. 
It is the biggest retail failure since Woolworths went bust in 2008. 
In a statement, administrators Duff &amp; Phelps said: &quot;The group (BHS) has been undergoing restructuring and, as has been widely reported, the shareholders have been in negotiations to find a buyer for the business. These negotiations have been unsuccessful.

&quot;In addition property sales have not materialised as expected in both number and value. Consequently, as a result of a lower-than-expected cash balance, the group is very unlikely to meet all contractual payments. 
It is thought that, along with Sports Direct, up to 30 other retailers may look to buy either a slimmed-down version of the business out of administration or pick over its store estate. 
However, experts warned that it was &quot;unlikely&quot; a buyer for the business in its current form would be found. 
Julie Palmer, partner at insolvency firm Begbies Traynor, said: &quot;As an under-performing brand that simply hasn&apos;t kept up with the pace of change in the retail sector and requires major investment, it looks increasingly unlikely that any buyer will be brave enough to salvage the business in anything like its current form.&quot; 
UPDATE: 10.03am Mon Apr 25 
BHS is expected to file for administration today, threatening almost 11,000 jobs. 
The retailer has reportedly sent a letter to staff, which said it will call in administrators after being unable to secure a rescue package to save the 88-year-old business. A formal announcement is expected at around noon. 
UPDATE: 7.27pm Sun Apr 24 
JOBS are on the line as a famous British clothing retailer - with a store in Newport - is facing the possibility of entering into liquidation, ending 88 years of trading. 
High street chain British Home Stores (BHS) could file for administration tomorrow, placing a total of 11,000 jobs at risk. 
Today, a spokesman said a statement is expected ‘sometime tomorrow (Monday) about BHS&apos;s future’. No other details were available, they added. 
Should the retailer close, it would be the biggest retail failure since Woolworths folded in 2008 with the loss of almost 30,000 jobs. 
A statement, posted on the BHS website on Friday, said: &quot;BHS would like to advise that despite some press speculation it is not in, nor has applied to go into administration. 
&quot;The website is operating and taking orders as usual.&quot; 
Sports Direct opened negotiations to buy some of BHS&apos;s 164 stores but it is understood any company would only buy the shops if it did not have to take on its £571 million pension deficit, according to the BBC. 
Entrepreneur Sir Philip Green, who owns Topshop, sold BHS last year. 
The fashion and homewares store was thrown a lifeline last month when creditors backed two company voluntary arrangements (CVA) designed to revive its ailing business by cutting costs and preventing widespread store closures. 
The company said the immediate future of the firm was secured when 95 per cent of creditors and landlords voted in favour of a CVA for BHS Limited, which represents 125 stores. 
A second CVA for BHS Properties Limited - which oversees 23 BHS stores - was also voted through with a majority of 75 per cent. Share:

Doc McCoy has been granted parole. The catch is that Sheriff Beynon expects a small favor from McCoy for his generosity: robbing another bank! Beynon does not really intend to let McCoy walk away after the heist and neither does co-robber Rudy Butler, but stopping Doc proves a trifle difficult. 
USA, 1972, In English, 122 min, Rated PG, Directed by Sam Peckinpah Upcoming Special Programs

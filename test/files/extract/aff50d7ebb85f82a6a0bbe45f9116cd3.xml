X X Jason Voorhees Kills Off A Victim In An Extremely Bloody Manner In Friday the 13th Trailer 25 News Ch, ch, ch, ch...ah ah ah ah! 
The official Friday the 13th game hype train keeps on rollin&apos;, as the game has met its Kickstarter goals and is on track for its eventual release, and there&apos;s a brand new trailer showing off one of the several ways Jason can deliver a swift and merciless death. 
The video showed up on the Friday the 13th game feed, and shows off an unfortunate victim having her head smashed into a door frame as Jason slams the door into her repeatedly. 
It&apos;s only about 20 seconds long, but it&apos;s gruesome enough to turn heads. It&apos;s alpha footage, and that&apos;s important to remember, and even as the victim&apos;s head explodes in the video, it doesn&apos;t really scream Jason to me just yet. I&apos;m hoping all this changes in the future. And maybe there&apos;s a little bit of Jason X thrown in as well, with the infamous sleeping bag scene. 
Friday the 13th: The Game will be slinking up on its unsuspecting victims this fall on PC, PS4, and Xbox One. 
So...how long until Twitter pulls this clip? pic.twitter.com/JeyTyRCYvY

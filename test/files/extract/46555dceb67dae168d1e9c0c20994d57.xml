The Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the largest energy firm in the world, is likely worth between $2 trillion and $2.5 trillion and will be turned into a holding company with publicly listed subsidiaries, the kingdom&apos;s deputy crown prince said Monday.
Less than 5% of the company, known as Saudi Aramco, will be publicly offered in a joint listing in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, possibly the U.S., said Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the second-in-line to the throne, in an interview with the Dubai-based television network Al Arabiya.
The prince outlined plans for Aramco as part of a plan to transform the kingdom&apos;s oil-dependent economy into one more focused on private enterprise.
The partial initial public offering will be one of the biggest in history, and will have many benefits including disclosure of all financial information on Aramco, he said.

Colorado won&apos;t be starting a database this year to track kids who have not been vaccinated 
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Published: 4/25/16 2:51 pm   2:51 pm EDT 
DENVER — Colorado won&apos;t be starting a database this year to track kids who have not been vaccinated. 
The state House backed off the proposed database Monday, when the proposal was scheduled for a vote. The legislative maneuver means the database proposal is dead for the year. 
Colorado has some of the nation&apos;s loosest rules for avoiding required vaccines. Parents must simply state that they have a medical, moral or religious objection, after which their kids may attend public schools. 
Democratic sponsors said vaccine exemptions should be tracked by state health authorities, not school nurses. 
But Republicans strongly opposed the database. Rep. Dan Pabon says Colorado will remain one of only about three states with no central tracking of childhood vaccinations.

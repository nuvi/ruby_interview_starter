The host Flint Hill Huskies (13-3, 6-2) salvaged a doubleheader split with the visiting St. James Saints from Hagerstown in Mid-Atlantic Athletic Conference high school baseball action April 23. 
St. James won the opener, 5-2, with Flint Hill taking the nightcap, 8-5. 
In the opener, St. James’ starting pitcher Mitch Wilson allowed six hits and struckout five. 
For Flint Hill, Justin Taylor (2 for 2) had an RBI double for an early 1-0 lead, then St. James answered with three runs and was ahead the rest of the way. 
In the nightcap, Flint Hill scored two runs in each of the first three innings to take an early 6-2 lead and held on behind the strong relief pitching of David Ross and closer Khalil Lee. 
Jordan Taylor got the win for the Huskies, but left the game with the bases loaded and no outs in fifth. Ross came in and got two ground ball outs and a strikeout to limit the damage. Lee earned the save pitching the last 1 1/3 innings. 
The Huskies were led at the plate by Justin Taylor going 2-4 with two doubles. Cameron Stork had a two-run triple in the nightcap and Lee and Rob Riddick each were 2 for 3.

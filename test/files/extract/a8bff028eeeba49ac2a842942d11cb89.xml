R&amp;B singer Billy Paul, mostly known for his 1972 hit single &quot;Me and Mrs. Jones&quot;, has passed away. He was 80. 
Paul died at his home in New Jersey on April 24 due to a &quot;serious medical condition&quot;, reports mirror.co.uk. He was recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. 
A statement on his website read: &quot;We regret to announce with a heavy heart that Billy has passed away today at home after a serious medical condition.&quot; 
&quot;We would like to extend our most sincere condolences to his wife Blanche and family for their loss, as they and the world grieves the loss of another musical icon that helped pioneer today&apos;s R&amp;B music. Billy will be truly missed,&quot; the statement continued. 
During his career, spanning more than 60 years, Paul bagged a Grammy for &quot;Me and Mrs. Jones&quot; in 1972. 
He continued to perform live until he fell ill and his manager said he had been lining up numerous appearances at the time of his death. 
He was born Paul Williams but later agreed to his manager&apos;s suggestion that he change his name to Billy Paul to avoid confusion with songwriter Paul Williams and other musicians with the same name. 
His early albums with Gamble and Huff, including &quot;Ebony Woman&quot; and &quot;Going East&quot;, sold modestly before &quot;Me And Mrs. Jones&quot; briefly made him a superstar. 
Paul is survived by wife Blanche, with whom he has two children.

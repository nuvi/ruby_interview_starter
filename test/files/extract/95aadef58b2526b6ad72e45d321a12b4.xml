OSHAWA, Ont. – A 45-year-old woman is facing charges after allegedly driving her children with a blood alcohol level nearly four times over the legal limit. 
Peterborough County Ontario Provincial Police say they received several calls about a driver on Highway 7 who seemed to be impaired. 
When police pulled her over on Sunday night, they found two children travelling as passengers in her car. 
They allege that her blood alcohol concentration was nearly four times over the limit for the province. 
Police say they believe calls from the public prevented what could have been a tragic outcome. 
The woman is charged with impaired driving and driving with more than 80 milligrams of alcohol in her blood. The Children’s Aid Society is also involved in the case. TAGS

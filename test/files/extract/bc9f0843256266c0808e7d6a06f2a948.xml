The contract will see 50 members of the Servest team provide cleaning, consumables, and waste services throughout the campus for the next three years.

Rob Legge, Servest’s CEO UK and Europe, said: “This contract with London Business School - one of the best business schools in Europe - will give Servest an enhanced presence in the education sector.

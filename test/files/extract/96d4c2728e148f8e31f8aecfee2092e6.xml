April 25, 2016 Henry Sy’s Belle Corp. prefers not to build another casino so it wouldn’t drive away the foot traffic from the Entertainment City but the firm’s top official argued it may be compelled to do so if the government will keep on allowing big casino projects to be developed in other parts of the country.
Belle Corp. is the group behind the US$1.2 billion integrated gaming complex City of Dreams (CoD) within the government’s Entertainment City in Parañaque. It also owns Premium Leisure Corp. (PLC) which operates half of the gaming operations in COD.
Willy Ocier, vice chairman of Belle Corp., said the company wants to put its focus on making CoD as profitable as it can but if competition would expand into other places such as Quezon City, they might as well consider it.
“If you ask me, there shouldn’t be more expansion [outside Entertaintment City]. We’ve put in a billion dollars in this thing. If the government allows small casinos here, there, everywhere, it defeats the purpose,” Ocier said, comparing the situation in the United States where Las Vegas casino had to suffer decline in gaming revenues when the government allowed gambling operations on Indian reservations or other tribal land in the country.
He also cited another example where all the casino operations in China must only be in Macau.
“In the Philippines, it should be like that. All the operations must be in the Entertainment City only. It defeats the purpose why we’re here as an integrated casino spending a billion US dollars… I hope PAGCOR [Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp.] should just direct all the traffic towards the Entertainment City because that is where the infrastructure is concentrated. You have Okada [Manila Bay Resorts] going in. It’s like double our size. Then you have Resorts World [Bayshore City Resorts World], which will probably double our size also. That’s the way it should be. I don’t mind competing in that kind of environment that we are all in this same area. Anyway people would jump from one casino to another,” Ocier told reporters on the sidelines of Belle Corp.’s annual stockholders meeting held in Pasay on Monday.
Ocier was particularly reacting to the report that another resort and casino developer, Bloomberry Resorts Corp., is planning to put up a mixed-use development with a hotel and casino somewhere in Quezon City. Bloomberry owns the Solaire Resort and Casino.
According to him, if that pushes through, Belle Corp. may have to make adjustments in its expansion plans.
“We will have to make the adjustments in term of our projections and strategies now that they are allowed to put up a casino in Quezon City. We will be riding on the existing license. In the license that we all have, it guarantees a level playing field. There is clause in our license that it should be a level playing field. In this level playing field, [ we will tell Pagcor] that if they are allowed to build, we should be allowed as well,” Ocier said.
As for Belle Corp.’s operations, Ocier said the company is optimistic that it will be profitable this year.
“Belle expects a significant part of future growth in total revenue and earnings to come from its investment in the gaming sector through its 78.7 percent-owned listed subsidiary PLC. PLC is the group’s gaming investment vehicle, with its revenues and income generated by its two subsidiaries, Premium Leisure and Amusement, Inc. [PLAI], a wholly-owned unlisted subsidiary that shares in the gaming earnings in City of Dreams Manila, and Pacific Online Systems Corp., a 50.1 percent owned listed company that supplies lottery and Keno equipment to the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office [PCSO],” Belle Corp. and PLC President Frederic Dybuncio said.

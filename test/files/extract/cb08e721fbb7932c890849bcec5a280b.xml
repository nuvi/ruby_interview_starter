Number of measles cases in Shelby County now at 6 Posted: Updated: 
MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) - Health officials say the number of measles cases in Shelby County has increased to six. 
The county&apos;s health department said Friday that it had confirmed two unrelated cases of the measles. On Monday, the department increased the total by four, saying some of the new cases are linked. 
Health department spokeswoman Elizabeth Hart says the sick people are expected to recover. Their identities are not being released. Health officials are reaching out to people who have been in contact with the measles victims. 
The health department says measles starts with a high fever, runny nose, cough and red eyes, followed a few days later by a rash. The highly contagious illness can lead to pneumonia or inflammation of the brain. 
The county has set up a measles hotline at 901-222-9299. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.   This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

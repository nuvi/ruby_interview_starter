Sports Xchange Monday 25th April, 2016 SAN DIEGO -- The Padres&apos; bullpen is in shambles, although San Diego manager Andy Green says his club has the pitchers needed to turn it around.
Over the past two games against the St. Louis Cardinals, six Padres relievers combined to allow 15 runs on 18 hits -- including four homers -- and four walks in just eight innings. 
In both games, the Padres held the lead when the bullpen went into operation. The results: 11-2 and 8-5 losses. 
&quot;It wasn&apos;t our best effort,&quot; Green said of the relief performances Saturday and Sunday. &quot;But we have plenty of capable pieces.&quot; 
Several Padres relievers experiencing serious problems. 
Right-hander Kevin Quackenbush, who entered Sunday&apos;s game with a two-run lead, gave up back-to-back homers to the first two hitters he faced, Jedd Gyorko and Aledmys Diaz. He has allowed nine runs (eight earned) on eight hits, including three homers, and four walks over six innings in his last six appearances. During that span, his ERA skyrocketed from 0.00 to 7.71. 
Brandon Maurer, who gave up three runs in the eighth Sunday, has a 
7.00 ERA. Carlos Villanueva gave up four runs in 1 2/3 innings Saturday, boosting his ERA to 5.91. Rule 5 rookie Luis Perdomo is operating with a 12.86 ERA after seven appearances. 
The most capable relievers this far are left-hander Ryan Buchter 
(0.93 ERA with 14 strikeouts in 9 2/3 innings over 10 appearances) and closer Fernando Rodney, who has a 0.00 ERA and three saves. 
The trouble is, the Padres can&apos;t get leads to Buchter and Rodney. share this story

No matter what happens the remainder of the season, the Yorktown Patriots have a significant signature win on their resume. 
In fact, Yorktown’s 17-13 non-conference victory in Vienna April 21 could be the most notable in program history, considering the Oakton Cougars’ rich past in girls high school lacrosse. Over the years, Oakton has won multiple conference, region and state championships. 
The victory was the Patriots’ third in a row, defeating Briar Woods, 24-15, and Washington-Lee, 18-6, for those other wins. 
Yorktown (6-5) defeated Oakton by rallying from a 6-5 deficit. When Laura Crawford converted a goal, the Patriots went ahead for good at 7-6. That goal triggered a run that gave Yorktown a 14-9 halftime lead. 
“We all came together and played as a complete unit,” Yorktown coach Crystal Fraser said. “At half, I told girls to keep riding the momentum – fight for everything. Oakton is always a good program.” 
Leading the win was Crawford with five goals, Kate Grattan and MacRae Knight with three, Claire Kuwana and Katie Calvo netted two each, and Emma Thurman and Sarah Bloomquist had one. Yorktown freshman goalie Sydney Stropes recorded 14 saves. 
“We’re proud of how we played,” Gratton said. “We’re going to use this as momentum for the rest of the season. It was a big team effort.” 
The Patriots won the draw controls, 20-12, with Crawford winning the majority and Thurman a few. 
“You need to find the ball as soon as you can and get to it – before the other girl and then box out,” Crawford said about the draw controls. “We knew it was going to be a big game. We were hyped. We tried to get the ball and go. This win means a lot to our head coach, because she went to Oakton.” 
Oakton coach Jean Counts credited Yorktown. 
“It was neck and neck early,” Counts said. “Their speed made a difference. We didn’t slow the ball down as well as we could have in the first half. In the second half, we had the ball more and we shot more - but their goalie made some good saves.” 
Against Washington-Lee, Stropes had 10 saves. Crawford had five goals and three assists, Grattan had five goals and two assists, Thurman had three goals and Knight and Bloomquist two each. 
In the win over Briar Woods, Stropes had 18 saves. Grattan had six goals and four assists, Crawford had six goals and three assists, Thurman netted four goals with two assists, and Kuwana and Calvo each had two goals. 
Kathleen Herrlein and Sissy Davis also contributed in the wins.

SEATTLE, WA--(Marketwired - Apr 25, 2016) - SkyKick (www.skykick.com), a global provider of cloud management software for information technology (IT) solution partners, announced today that it has added three new executives to its team.

Chike Farrell has been named SkyKick&apos;s vice president of marketing; Kathryn Saducas as general manager of Western Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and Anthony Philips as general manager of business development for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). 
&quot;We&apos;re in the early stages of the next seismic shift of IT,&quot; said SkyKick co-CEO Todd Schwartz. &quot;With IDC forecasting that worldwide public IT cloud services revenue will reach $141.2 billion by 2019, the cloud will continue to be a driving force in how people work. It is more important than ever for IT partners to have the most robust platform to move, backup and manage their customers in the cloud.&quot; 
&quot;SkyKick&apos;s mission is to help partners succeed in the cloud,&quot; said SkyKick co-CEO Evan Richman. &quot;Today more than 5,000 IT solution providers in 125 countries rely on SkyKick to deliver cloud migration, backup and management services for their customers, which also provides new cloud revenue streams for those partners. With these hires, we&apos;ll be able to better help these partners and expand our global footprint.&quot;

AN innovative redevelopment of a village church&apos;s north aisle has led to a national award nomination. 
St Deinst in Llangarron, near Ross -on-Wye, remodelled its north aisle to create The Garron Centre for community use. 
The project has been shortlisted with six others from around the country for The Marsh Awards for Innovative Projects. 
The new competition, run jointly by the National Churches Trust and the Marsh Christian Trust, seeks to find churches running the most innovative community activities made possible through the installation of new facilities. 
The Garron Centre hosts a monthly community café, art exhibitions, a pop-up restaurant, classes including French and willow weaving, film afternoons, concerts, quiz nights, and private events such as birthday parties. 
Stephen Bradley, who was project manager, said: “Our objective throughout has been to create a high quality, efficient environment which complements the character of the Victorian building with modern but appropriate building methods. 
“We also wanted to take advantage of environmentally friendly technology where practical so, for example, the space is heated by under floor heating which in turn is powered by a combination of solar panels and air-source heat pumps.” 
The building project repaired the north aisle, removed the old pipe organ, created a mezzanine floor, built a kitchen and toilets, put in sliding doors between the new space and the rest of the church, and added underfloor heating, broadband, and solar panels.&quot; 
The Llangarron Community Association (LCA) was set up in 2004, originally as a sub-group of the Parochial Church Council, to work towards making the north aisle a community space. 
The LCA is now a Charitable Incorporated Organisation and has a 10-year lease which started in 2014 when the centre opened. 
The centre cost more than £450,000- most of which was funded by the Reaching Communities Buildings arm of the Big Lottery. 
Additional financial support was provided by Garfield Weston Foundation, Herefordshire Historic Churches Trust and Severn Waste Services. 
The project was nominated for the award by Herefordshire Historic Churches Trust and architect Richard Lamb (Hook Mason) and the church&apos;s temporary vicar Reverend Richard Jones provided more information. 
Claire Walker, chief executive of the National Churches Trust, said: “The impressive shortlist for The Marsh Awards for Innovative Projects demonstrates how churches can do invaluable work for communities if they have the right facilities available.&quot; 
The winner will be announced by the Dean of Wakefield at the Churches Trust Forum Annual Conference in York on May 19, and will be awarded a £1,000 prize. A runner up will be awarded a £500 prize. Share:

Switch to US Edition Boy Opens Lemonade Stand To Fund His Adoption Tristan Jacobsen was abandoned at a shelter four years ago by his biological mother, whose life was plagued by drug abuse. 19:55, UK, Monday 25 April 2016 Tristan has raised way more than the $5,000 he needs for legal fees Share on Facebook By Sky News US Team A nine-year-old US boy has raised thousands of dollars selling lemonade to help pay for his own formal adoption. 
Tristan Jacobsen set up his stand outside his kinship guardians&apos; home at the weekend in Springfield, Missouri, selling drinks for $1. 
Donnie and Jimmy Davis told the Springfield News-Leader the third-grader&apos;s stall raised $7,100 together with a yard sale towards the adoption legal fees. 
A further $10,000 has been donated to the adoption fund on YouCaring.com. Tristan sold lemonade for $1 a drink 
Ms Davis said Tristan&apos;s biological parents were her ex-husband and a 15-year-old girl. 
The Davises took Tristan into their home after his birth mother - whose life spiralled into drug addiction and prostitution - abandoned him at a shelter in January 2012. 
She says the boy was initially placed in a class for students with behavioural problems and was prescribed anti-depressants, but his well-being has since hugely improved. &apos;This child will forever be ours,&apos; says Ms Davis 
Ms Davis says she and her husband already consider Tristan their son, but want to make it official. 
The family only needed $5,000 for the legal and adoption fees, and say the extra will go towards Tristan&apos;s education. 
&quot;There&apos;s not enough words to say &apos;thank you&apos; to everyone who has shown support or given us donations,&quot; Ms Davis told the News-Leader. 
&quot;Everyone has made this possible. We will make sure this child will forever be ours.&quot; 
Tristan wants to change his name to Quill Tristan Davis. By posting a comment you are agreeing to abide by our Terms &amp; Conditions . See our House Rules and FAQs . Top Stories

By Tony Ubani with Agency Reports Kelechi Iheanacho&apos;s star performance against Stoke has earned him praise from Super Eagles Coach Salisu Yusuf. Iheanacho scored a brace and was responsible for winning the penalty that Sergio Aguero converted for City&apos;s second. Yusuf, elated by the teenager&apos;s performance said that the boy has come of age and would be an asset for the Super Eagles. &quot;Iheanacho is doing great which is a good sign for the national team,&quot; Salisu said. &quot;Playing well for top clubs like City despite the young age shows that he has come of age in the game. &quot;Iheanacho has showed signs of what he can do when given the opportunity with the national team, and I can say here that people are going to see more of him and other young players in the Super Eagles&quot;, Salisu noted. Meanwhile, the Manchester City striker is already dreaming of facing star-studded Real Madrid in the Champions League tomorrow in Etihad. He is is not expected to be included in Manuel Pellegrini&apos;s starting XI for Tuesday&apos;s Champions League semi final first leg. But his two goals against Stoke on Saturday proved what an asset he could be from the bench. The 19-year-old has scored 11 goals since breaking into City&apos;s first team this season - prompting Pellegrini to identify him as one of the rising stars who could shine under incoming manager Pep Guardiola. And ahead of Real and the prospect of facing Zinedine Zidane&apos;s Galacticos, Iheanacho said: &quot;I think I should dream about that because it&apos;s a great team to dream about. &quot;It would be a dream come true to play against them. &quot;I think I&apos;ll be happy when I play against them.&quot; Iheanacho hopes his performance in the 4-0 win against Stoke will force him into Pellegrini&apos;s thinking against Real.

Bethlehem officials show lack of respect to residents Bethlehem City Council HARRY FISHER / The Morning Call Bethlehem resident Steve Melnick tells City Council Tuesday why he opposes a proposal to build a public parking garage on the city&apos;s South Side. Bethlehem resident Steve Melnick tells City Council Tuesday why he opposes a proposal to build a public parking garage on the city&apos;s South Side. (HARRY FISHER / The Morning Call) Why Bethlehem officials are hypocritical 
I support the proposed development at South New and Third streets in Bethlehem and understand the need to add more public parking. 
What I have trouble understanding — and can&apos;t support — is the way that city government officials rigorously enforce the applicable historic district ordinance on homeowners who want to replace windows or businesses who want to hang signs, but those same officials turn their backs on those same regulations when it comes to addressing the scale of development such as the proposed parking garage. 
I also find it incredible that the developer of this project would receive 57 &quot;free&quot; spaces in the parking deck while I and all other Bethlehem taxpayers and residents face increases in contract parking and meter rates. The residents of this city are also the ones who will guarantee the bond to finance the garage. 
The hypocrisy of public officials and the lack of respect they show to the taxpayers and residents of Bethlehem are disgusting. 
Shouldn&apos;t the vision for Bethlehem and its future be that of its residents and taxpayers, not the ideas of a select few? This is a democracy, not an oligarchy. Perceived entitlement and perceived privilege have no place. Everyone should be treated equally.

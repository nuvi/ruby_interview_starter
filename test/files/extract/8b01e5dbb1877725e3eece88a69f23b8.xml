The Ballad Of Jane Got A Gun – Motion Picture Maniac ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ 
Oh this is a tale of a western flick 
That was gonna to be made by this Ramsey chick 
But producers be damned if they gotta play fair 
So Miss Ramsey left in madness and despair 
See Lynn Ramsey was promised some fair amount of cash 
To make movie that was sure for a box office smash 
But for some strange reason those powers that be 
Decided they would take back that promise and see 
If Miss Ramsey would work for a much smaller price 
And obey all commands despite the cheque slice 
Now for Ramsey, final cut was an absolute must 
But producers made sure that that would go bust 
So with fairness and support all buried in a pit 
Miss Ramsey left the film and told them where to stick “it” 
And the producers were left with something of an itch 
“Who shall we hire to replace that bitch?” 
And in was brought a Mr. Gavin O’Connor 
To help get them out of their celluloid bother 
His last film, Warrior, didn’t make much 
But was loved by most of the film club bunch 
So off he set to make Jane Got A Gun 
A film starring Natalie Portman 
About a girl named Jane who indeed had a gun 
In a tale of revenge set beneath the desert sun 
With Ewan McGregor and Joel Edgerton 
A movie was made that could be barrels of fun 
But that’s not quite true, while the film was finished 
The result we have feels a little bit kidish 
Now maybe tension was the goal to be fair 
But it’s a film that’s been made without much care 
And while the sets are nice and the costumes are class 
The pace moves along like an old dead ass 
Have you ever heard of Mike Cimino’s Heaven’s gate? 
It’s another western that received much hate 
See the critics all found that the film was a snore 
An overlong drag, a pretentious bore 
Jane got a gun feels somewhat the same 
It’s a western with guns that’s a little bit lame 
It’s very slow and boring and nothing goes on 
And the whole time I was thinking “this is just plain wrong” 
To be fair it looks nice with some stellar camera work 
But McGregor acts like a strange old burk 
What was with his accent? I do not know 
But it was even worse than Russell Crowe 
Natalie Portman isn’t all that good 
She doesn’t do what I know she could 
It’s not quite as bad as Attack Of The Clones 
But she has forgotten to use different tones 
Almost everything she says is bland and dull 
And I listened while praying for a brick to the skull 
This film has no idea exactly what it is 
It’s a western with a story that should make you jizz 
You have a woman and some men held up in a cabin 
While a gang with guns come for shooting and stabbing 
With a story like this it sounds exciting and fun 
So imagine my surprise when it turned out glum 
It seems forgetful of the very core of its roots 
And is as boring as staring at some shit covered boots 
The actors seem lacking in proper direction 
And spout crappy lines in need of correction 
The film drags on, and on and on it goes 
And when you think it’s gonna speed up, it actually slows 
I’m not an action nut to be perfectly fair 
But there’s nothing else in this film for which I care 
And the story sounds like a bullet banging rush 
But there’s hardly any action that results in gush 
The narrative is poor and all over the shop 
Constant flashbacks make this a story telling plop 
The characters are boring and really rather sappy 
It’s especially sad when the credits make you happy 
With the title that it has, you’d expect this to be great 
But the title is nothing if not audience bait 
If Lynn Ramsey wasn’t bullied, it might have been cool 
And Gavin O’Connor is no overpaid tool 
But he had no time to obtain a full blast 
And we’re left with a film I’m glad is in the past 
It’s not badly made but it’s badly written 
With dialogue as bad as a choking kitten 
I don’t recommend this boring little mess 
Whether or not you like it is a risky guess 
And while I don’t think it really caused red-hot hate 
I’d like this movie to be off my slate.

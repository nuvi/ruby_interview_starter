Lucky Peak Nursery: Arbor Day Arbor Dayh CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST 
The Idaho Forest Products Commission wants us to plant a tree this weekend. It is all part of Arbor Day and all the Home Depot locations will be giving away seedlings for us to plant. This is a great time to teach children about the importance of trees and forests to Idaho and how many products and jobs are connected to our forests and how more trees are planted each year then are harvested. Remember when you plant the seeding it will become a large tree and will need lots of space.

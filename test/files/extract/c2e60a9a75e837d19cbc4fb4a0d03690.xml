“This new sequence does a much better job of segmenting out the different tissues in the body so we can get accurate attenuation correction maps and account for the effects of cardiac motion, which is the other source of artifacts,” said study co-author Dr. Marc Dweck, British Heart Foundation senior lecturer at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine. “With low-radiation scans of less than 5 mSv, we can get very interesting information about disease activity within the heart.” { read more here }

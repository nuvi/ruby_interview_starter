DIFS releases new video series for Money Smart Week File Photo By Jessica McLean, , @jessmax1hope on Twitter Posted: # Comments 
The Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services (DIFS) is releasing a new video series, “My Money and Me”, as a part of Money Smart Week, the broadest and most comprehensive financial education program in the country. 
The series will focus on useful instruction for consumers on how to develop a more responsible and productive relationship with money. The department hopes consumers will use the easy to follow worksheets to identify and work through money-related issues, so they can be better equipped to manage their personal finances. 
Money Smart Week itself was started in 2002 in Chicago with just 40 programs, and has expanded to become the only national education program for people of all ages. 
“Money Smart Week is a great opportunity for Michigan consumers to learn more about managing their personal finances. I encourage all consumers to utilize every resource available,” said DIFS Director Patrick McPharlin. Advertisement 
The week and the video series will also help the department spearhead its third annual Securing MI Financial Future (SMFF) initiative in October, which connects Michigan residents with financial information and resources. 
The videos were sponsored by several organizations, including the Michigan Credit Union League and Affiliates, Michigan Association of CPAs and others.

The Philadelphia Eagles’ decision to trade up in this week’s NFL draft could end Sam Bradford’s time with the team.
The deal to trade for the Cleveland Browns’ No2 pick means it is likely that the Eagles will take North Dakota State quarterback Carson Wentz later this week. Although the Eagles are understood to want to keep Bradford as their starter while Wentz develops, ESPN reports Bradford now wants out and will not participate in any off-season training.

Bradford agreed a new deal with the Eagles in February, which included an $11m signing bonus – although his base salary of $7m is relatively low for a starting quarterback. The Denver Broncos, Cleveland Browns and New York Jets are among the teams that may be interested in a solid starting quarterback. Bradford was the No1 overall pick in the 2010 draft but has failed to live up to his billing in a career that has been blighted by injury so far.
Last season the Eagles were 7-7 with Bradford as a starter, and he threw19 touchdowns and 14 interceptions.

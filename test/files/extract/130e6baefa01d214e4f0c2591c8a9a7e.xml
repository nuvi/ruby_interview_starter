So far this boys lacrosse season, Anne Arundel County has impressively had the better of things against their Howard counterparts. 
The two counties came together for a season-long mixer with games against each other every week. 
Last week, Anne Arundel claimed five of the six games against Howard competition. On Tuesday, most notably South River beat then-No. 14 Mount Hebron, No. 8 Broadneck handled Glenelg, and No. 9 Severna Park took care of Howard. On the season, Anne Arundel is 12-6 and its top two teams -- Broadneck and Severna Park -- have dominated some of Howard&apos;s finest. 
The Bruins (9-0) are 3-0 with wins over Howard, Glenelg and Marriotts Ridge. 
The Falcons (8-2) beat Howard, Mount Hebron and Glenelg. 
North County also is 3-0 against Howard competition. 
The series resumes this afternoon when Mount Hebron visits Arundel and continues with more games on Wednesday.

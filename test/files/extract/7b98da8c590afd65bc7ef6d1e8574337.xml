Peter Dinklage urges you to Face Your Food Featured A School in Texas Could Be Named After Adolf Hitler A community in Austin, Texas, wants to name its primary school &apos;Adolf Hitler School for Friendship and Tolerance&apos;. 25 April 2016 Hitler&apos;s name for a primary school? 
A community in Austin, Texas, wants to name its primary school &apos;Adolf Hitler School for Friendship and Tolerance&apos;. 
When the board of governors asked for suggestions to re-brand the educational institute, there were some very odd suggestions, including naming it after the most hated man in modern history. 
Other suggestions were, &apos;Bruce Lee Elementary&apos;, &apos;Schooly McSchoolerson&apos;, - in reference to the internet&apos;s response to naming a new £200 Million Royal Research Ship &apos;Boaty McBoatface&apos; - and &apos;Bleeding Heart Liberal Elementary&apos;. 
One local Twitter user said they&apos;d love it if the school was named after WWE star and reality TV host John Cena. 
They penned: &apos;&apos;Robert E. Lee Elementary in Austin is changing its name. I would absolutely send my kids to John Cena Elem.(sic)&apos;&apos; 
The suggestions are being put to a vote and &apos;Donald J. Trump Elementary&apos; is currently in the lead with 45 nominations.

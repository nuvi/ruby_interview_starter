Audio between the pilot of Prince&apos;s jet and ground control revealed medical personnel would be present as soon as the plane landed
Audio has emerged of the moment a pilot transporting Prince on a flight six days prior to his death requested emergency medical treatment for his passenger.
The audio reveals the pilot was requesting permission to land in Moline, Illinois where a &apos;certified first responder&apos; would be waiting on the tarmac.
Obtained by TMZ , the recording details how traffic controllers organised for the plane to land on the airport&apos;s &apos;north ramp&apos; during the emergency.
They also ask if the passenger is male or female, suggesting his identity was not revealed during the call.
He had been suffering from flu for a number of weeks and was believed to be recovering, but took a turn for the worse.
It comes as the legendary singer&apos;s brother-in-law reportedly claimed Prince did not sleep for six days prior to his death.
And he also appeared &apos;pale&apos; and &apos;weak&apos; during one of his last public appearances, witnesses said.
Employees at Electric Fetus record shop in Minneapolis said the musician did not look &apos;in the best shape&apos; when he visited the store five days before he was found at his Paisley Park estate.
Prince&apos;s brother-in-law Maurice Phillips reportedly claimed the singer had worked for six days without sleep when friends and family held a private service at the compound on Saturday.
Mr Phillips, who is married to Prince&apos;s sister Tyka Nelson, is said to have told fans outside Paisley Park: &apos;He worked 154 hours straight. I was with him just last weekend. He was a good brother-in-law.&apos;

EXCLUSIVE: &apos;Has anyone ever told you that you look a lot... Max Timander, who works at Electric Fetus, said Prince visited a day after the Purple Rain star was rushed to hospital when his plane made an emergency landing in Atlanta, Georgia.
TMZ reported that he had overdosed on a painkiller called Percocet at the time.
Mr Timander told the Press Association: &apos;Everyone I&apos;ve talked to on that Saturday said he looked kind of pale and he was not totally looking in the best shape as he normally is.
&apos;It sounded like he was looking kind of weak. I know he had just got over the flu supposedly.&apos;
The mayor of Chanhassen, the city which is home to Paisley Park, said discussions were taking place to stage a public service in honour of Prince in the Minneapolis area.
&apos;It&apos;s clear his friends and family would support the idea,&apos; Denny Laufenburger said.
A private funeral service at a local church is expected to take place in early May, he added.
Prince was found collapsed in a lift by staff members on Thursday morning, more than 12 hours after he was last seen alive when he was dropped off at Paisley Park.
The 57-year-old singer was pronounced dead at the scene.

KENSINGTON, Brooklyn — 64-year-old Clarence Jones who is accused of targeting the elderly in a series of home invasions has been arrested, NYPD confirms. 
His most recent attack came at the beginning of April when he followed an 83-year-old woman into her building on Ocean Parkway in Kensington, the NYPD said. Once the victim was inside her apartment, she opened the door to the man, who then hit her in the face with a hard object, according to cops. He didn’t take any items from her home and ran away. 
The NYPD said the new footage is from a surveillance system near the apartment building where the incident happened. It shows the alleged thief, who appears to be between 40 to 60 years old, wearing glasses and a black jacket walking away. 
Less than two weeks ago, on March 19, the man followed 43-year-old man into his residence and demanded money. He then saw a 81-year-old woman and approached her at gunpoint and with a box cutter, also demanding for money. There were no injuries as a result. He fled on foot with about $330. 
On March 2, he approached a 91-year-old woman from behind as she entered her Park Slope building, placed her in a chokehold and displayed a handgun, police said. After he pushed her aside, he demanded money and as he was removing it, a 50-year-old man came across the pair. The man pointed his handgun at the victim and took his money as well. He took off with approximately $370. Photo Gallery View Gallery (3 images) 
On February 11, he followed a 71-year-old woman into her Park Slope residence, attempted to tie her up, displayed a firearm and struck her on the left side of the lip causing laceration, police said. He ran away with $375. 
On January 20, he followed a 76-year-old woman into her Ridgewood home and allegedly put his hands over her mouth before pushing her inside, police said. He then demanded money at knifepoint and pointed his gun at an 87-year-old man demanding more money, police said. He left with about $800. 
An earlier release from police showed Jones was wanted for a similar home invasion in Norwood, the Bronx in September 2014.

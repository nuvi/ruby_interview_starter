Grants make renovations possible at Grange Comment Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 9:09 AM By Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 9:09 AM » Social News ACUSHNET — Thanks to several grants, the historic Acushnet Grange is undergoing a transformation. The renovation and upgrades should make the Grange more inviting and accessible to local groups. Students from Old Colony Regional Vocational Technical High School are doing all the work. Garry Rawcliffe, Grange master and a selectman, said they are using funding from the Community Preservation Act, state Green Communities Act and the national Grange. &quot;It&apos;s almost done,&quot; Rawcliffe said Tuesday. Rawcliffe said the students are from carpentry and electrical classes and that they &quot;upgraded a lot of the electrical.&quot; The building also got new shingles and a handicap-ramp. Vinyl siding was replaced with shingles on the back side of the building. Several local groups use the Grange facility. Rawcliffe said that use may expand now that the community center on Middle Road has been converted to a new town library. &quot;Hopefully we&apos;ll use it as a polling place,&quot; Rawcliffe said. If so, it will replace the polling place for a precinct that voted at the community center. Boy Scout Troop #251 has used the Grange for meetings and the Wampanoag Kennel Club uses a Grange building next door to the one being renovated. Rawcliffe said the Acushnet Agricultural Commission has said it may hold some classes there. The Grange has traditionally been an organization that helps farmers. Rawcliffe said it has transitioned to also help hobby farmers and farmers markets. By

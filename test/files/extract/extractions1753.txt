A Spartanburg, S.C., sheriff is facing backlash for claiming earlier this month that minorities are sometimes “the most racist people in America right now” and comparing the NAACP to the Klu Klux Klan.

Speaking during a Greenville-Spartanburg Republican Women’s meeting April 7, Sheriff Chuck Wright, who is running for re-election, argued that the NAACP is a racist organization because it focuses on advancing rights for only one race, citing an African-American friend of his who feels the same way.
“I’ve got a chaplain who works for me — he’s an African-American, he is my brother and I love him more than anything,” Wright said, according to WYFF-TV . “He doesn’t buy into that mess. A bunch of his friends don’t either. They don’t do the NAACP because I feel like that is a racist group as well as the KKK. I don’t care about them either.”
Wright asserted that he does not want people to associate with a group “that’s got something to do just because of your color” because he doesn’t feel they are “right.”
“I think if we would quit worrying about Democrats or Republicans and just love our neighbors as God told us to, we’re gonna be better. We’re just gonna be better,” he said.
However, his opponent, Russell Lynch, an Independent, finds Wright’s comments “embarrassing” and “not conducive to solving those problems and addressing those issues and building those relationships with anybody, minorities included.”
“It’s an embarrassment to a law enforcement for a law enforcement professional to sum a group like the NAACP up as being a racist organization,” Lynch said. “Because the group I’ve been dealing with in Spartanburg, they’ve been nothing but good people.”
Wright later walked back his comments, saying the NAACP’s Spartanburg chapter “tries to help everybody.”
“There’s a very small group within that group, they’re divisive, and I don’t buy into that mess,” he said. “I certainly wasn’t pointing a finger at anybody. I don’t care about any group or any person who doesn’t respect you just because of whatever color God made you.”

The NAACP was formed in 1909. At that time there wasn\u2019t any need for an organization to advance the rights of white people although the KKK was formed to prevent blacks from being given the same rights as white people around that time. Blacks weren\u2019t even guaranteed the right to vote until the Voting Rights Act in 1965.
I personally don\u2019t see analogy between the NAACP and the KKK as accurate. As far as I know the NAACP isn\u2019t advocating sending all white people back to Europe or all Mexicans back to Mexico. Or preventing white people from voting or suggesting white people be lynched.
I don\u2019t see it myself although I understand the victimization of white people like you and me seeing that our country is becoming more brown and black and seeing that brown and black people are more and more coming to positions of power in our country (Obama, duh). Not to mention the increasing acceptance of LGBT community among Americans..
I get it. It\u2019s scary. The world is changing and fast. I wonder if this sheriff will be able to keep his job.

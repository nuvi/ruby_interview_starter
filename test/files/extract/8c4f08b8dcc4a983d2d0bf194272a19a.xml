S top smoking services should be cut to fund meningitis b vaccinations for more children, MPs have said.
More than 820,000 people have now signed an e-petition calling for all children under 11 to be given the meningitis jab, which is currently only available for babies under 12 months.
At a debate in Westminster Hall, Tory MP Ben Howlett said discussions were ongoing with vaccine manufactures GlaxoSmithKline to lower the costs for the NHS so more children could receive the shot.
But David Nuttall, the Tory MP for Bury North, said money should be diverted away from helping smokers to pay for the extra jabs.
“I am not one to bring problems without trying to find solutions for government, so let me also suggest another source of funding,” he told MPs.
“The millions of pounds spent on trying to persuade those adults, who despite years and years or warnings of the dangers of smoking, nevertheless continue to do so.
“If they have not stopped by now, when will they? These adults have a choice. They choose to continue to smoke. Some of the millions spent on increasingly ineffective stop smoking campaigns could be spent on children who have no choice.&quot;

Harmonie-Rose Allen, from Bath, lost both arms and legs and doctors were even forced to remove the tip of her nose after she was struck down with meningitis B at just 11 months old.
At the debate he called for an immediate catch-up vaccination programme for all under-fives.
“Someone from every one of our 650 constituencies signed the petition and gives a strong indication of the public support to eradicate this disease,” he said.
“Menengitis b is an evil disease which kills or maims hundreds of childcare in the UK every year. We need to eradicate it as soon as possible. I hope this leads to a new action firm the government
“Campaigns have brought about change and I can only hope this campaign has gathered enough momentum.”
The e-petition has received the most signatures than any other to date, following the publication of several highly emotive and harrowing photographs of young victims and their stories.
They include the plight of two year old Faye Burdett who was killed by the disease on Valentines Day, coupled with the revelation that the two year old son of former England ruby captain Matt Dawson was battling meningitis c.

David Winnick, MP for Walsall North, where the family live said: &quot;My constituents Mr and Mrs Timmins understandably of the very strong view that all children should have meningitis b vaccination.
“Indeed in the case of her daughter, who is three, Mrs Timmins arranged for that to be done privately. She feels that had Mason had the vaccination at the time he would have survived.
“I don’t know whether the reluctance is to do with cost. What I do know is that if children can be saved from the sort of fate of Mr and Mrs Timmins&apos; son then in those circumstances action should be taken along the lines that they urge.
“I can’t accept and I don’t think any honourable members that it is a matter of cost, and for reasons of cost no action should be taken. This is a very important debate. Children have lost their lives. Parents are grieving.”

Jay Electronica put his ego aside to apologize for his past transgressions. 
It’s no secret that Jay Electronica had issues with Kendrick Lamar and dissed Drake, J. Cole, and 50 Cent . But today, he’s apologizing for it. 
Well, everyone didn’t get an apology, but K.Dot and 50 Cent received peace and blessings from the Roc Nation rapper. lastly, peace to K dot and TDE because regardless to whom or what we are brothers fighting the same enemy. forgive my past transgressions

Well I guess it ain’t a surprise no more .” Peace To Chance The Rapper. We about to surprise attack y&apos;all. well i guess it aint a surprise no more. But its still an attack! lol

No word on when we’ll be getting Jay Elec and Chance’s collaboration, but Summer Sixteen seems to be the most popular release time.

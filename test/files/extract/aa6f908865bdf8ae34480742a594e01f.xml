New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady will have to serve his four-game Deflategate suspension after all, following an appeals court ruling that has reinstated his original ban.
The second US circuit court of appeals in New York announced its two-to-one decision on Monday, and the ruling could bring to a close a scandal that led to months of disagreement over air pressure, PSI gauges – and the reputation of one of the NFL’s best players.

“We hold that the [NFL] commissioner properly exercised his broad discretion under the collective bargaining agreement, and that his procedural rulings were properly grounded in that agreement and did not deprive Brady of fundamental fairness,” the three-judge panel wrote.
Brady was suspended for four games for his role in the ball-tampering controversy surrounding the Patriots’ 45-7 victory over the Colts in the 2015 AFC Championship game, but his ban was overturned after the Patriots appealed. Brady played the entire 2015 season as the Pats went to the championship game again before losing to Denver.
But Brady, for now at least, will have to sit out the first four games of the new season. The Pats open against the Cardinals, and then play the Dolphins, the Texans and the Bills. If Brady and New England decide not to appeal the decision, the team would be without their star player for a quarter of the season.
Brady and the Patriots can appeal against the ruling to the full second circuit, or even to the US supreme court, but any petition would be costly, time-consuming and tiring.
The three-judge panel sided 2-1 with the NFL , who brought the appeal, and said Brady was treated fairly.
In a majority opinion written by Judge Barrington Parker, the second circuit said: “Our role is not to determine for ourselves whether Brady participated in a scheme to deflate footballs, or whether the suspension imposed by the commissioner should have been for three games or five games or none at all. Nor is it our role to second-guess the arbitrator’s procedural rulings.
“Our obligation is limited to determining whether the arbitration proceedings and award met the minimum legal standards established by the Labor Management Relations Act.”
Chief judge Robert Katzmann, however, dissented. “I am troubled by the commissioner’s decision to uphold the unprecedented four-game suspension,” he said. “The commissioner failed to even consider a highly relevant alternative penalty.”
The NFL Players Association said in a statement it was disappointed with the ruling, and insisted that Brady’s “rights were violated”.
“We fought Roger Goodell’s suspension of Tom Brady because we know he did not serve as a fair arbitrator and that players’ rights were violated under our collective bargaining agreement,” the statement read. “Our union will carefully review the decision, consider all of our options and continue to fight for players’ rights and for the integrity of the game.”
NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Goodell had acted properly in handing down the four-game suspension.
“That authority has been recognized by many courts and has been expressly incorporated into every collective bargaining agreement between the NFL and NFLPA for the past 40 years,” McCarthy said.
Brady recently reworked his deal with the Patriots, and converted much of his salary to bonus money. Brady will only be paid $1m in salary in 2016, but the Patriots have agreed to a $28m signing bonus as compensation.
Brady will forfeit four game checks when he serves his suspension. But the new, lower-salary contract means the checks are lower this time. Under his old contract, his $9m salary would have meant a loss of more than $2m over four games. His new $1m salary means the suspension will now cost him only $235,000.
At oral arguments in March, appeals judges did not seem sold on the arguments made by the union on Brady’s behalf. Judge Denny Chin said evidence of ball tampering was “compelling, if not overwhelming” and there was evidence that Brady “knew about it, consented to it, encouraged it.”
The league argued that it was fair for Goodell to severely penalize Brady after he concluded the prize quarterback tarnished the game by impeding the NFL’s investigation by destroying a cellphone containing nearly 10,000 messages.
Judge Parker said the cellphone destruction raised the stakes “from air in a football to compromising the integrity of a proceeding that the commissioner had convened.”
“So why couldn’t the commissioner suspend Mr Brady for that conduct alone?” he asked. Parker added: “With all due respect, Mr Brady’s explanation of that made no sense whatsoever.”

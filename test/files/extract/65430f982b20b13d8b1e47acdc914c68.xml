tweet now! WASHINGTON (Sinclair Broadcast Group) — 
As the title and name of its lead villain imply, &quot; X-Men: Apocalypse &quot; is poised to be an epic battle for Earth&apos;s survival. 
That much has been clear since the project was announced and we got our first look at Apocalypse himself . 
But on Monday, 21st Century Fox and the film&apos;s director Bryan Singer continued to tease fans with the release of the flick&apos;s final trailer, giving us a little more perspective on the project that could give &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; a run for its money at the battle of the box office. 
Here&apos;s what we gathered from the final trailer for &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot;: 
A New Leader? 
Jennifer Lawrence&apos;s Mystique character appears to take on more of a leadership role after Professor X is &quot;taken&quot; by Apocalypse. 
&quot;Taken&quot; is the word used in the trailer after we clearly see Xavier get his butt kicked by an all-powerful Apocalypse. 
Rad Fights 
There is plenty of in-fighting between mutants, including what appears to be a cage match between Angel and Nightcrawler. 
Cyclops throws down with Storm. Psylocke tangos with Beast. Prof. X gets trounced by Apocalypse. You get the idea. 
Where&apos;s Hugh? 
Wolverine makes an appearance in this movie, although neither Hugh Jackman nor the character has been heavily featured at all in the build-up to May 27. Wolverine&apos;s claws get less than a second of screen time in the final trailer. 
Daddy Drama 
Quicksilver is Magneto&apos;s son officially. &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; alluded to the relationship between the speedy mutant and his metal-attracting pops, but now it&apos;s spelled out in no uncertain terms. How this plays out in &quot;Apocalypse&quot; could be interesting considering Magneto goes full-on bad guy pledging his loyalty to &quot;Apocalypse&quot; as one of the Four Horsemen. component-story-more_media_horiz-v1-01

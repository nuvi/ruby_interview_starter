No screenshots, No pictures with added/superimposed text. This includes image macros , comics, infographics and most diagrams. Text (e.g. a URL) serving to credit the original author is exempt. 
No porn or gore. NSFW content must be tagged. 
No personal information. This includes anything hosted on Facebook&apos;s servers, as they can be traced to the original account holder. Stalking &amp; harassment will not be tolerated. No missing-persons requests! 
No post titles soliciting votes (e.g. &quot;upvote this&quot;). 
No DAE, &quot;[FIXED]&quot;, &quot;cake day&quot;, or &quot;photoshop this&quot; posts, nor posts addressed to a specific redditor. &quot;[FIXED]&quot; posts should be added as a comment to the original image. Photoshop requests should be directed to /r/PhotoshopRequest 
Submissions must link directly to a specific image file or to a website with minimal ads. We do not allow blog hosting of images (&quot;blogspam&quot;), but links to albums on image hosting websites are okay. URL shorteners are prohibited. URLs in image or album descriptions are prohibited. 
No animated images. Please submit them to /r/gif , /r/gifs , or /r/reactiongifs instead. 
Please be civil when commenting. Racist/sexist/homophobic comments and personal attacks against other redditors do not belong here. 
If your submission appears to be filtered, but definitely meets the above rules, please send us a message with a link to the comments section of your post (not a direct link to the image). Don&apos;t delete it as that just makes the filter hate you! 
If you come across any rule violations please report the submission or message the mods and one of us will remove it! 
Please note: serial reposters may be filtered 
Please also try to come up with original post titles . Submissions that use certain clichés/memes will be automatically tagged with a warning. 
Professional photographer or artist? Read these guidelines for linking to your own site and obtaining &apos;Verified&apos; user flair. 
Is OP a reposting hack? Are the mods not satisfying your thirst for justice? Then you better call KarmaCourt ! Links

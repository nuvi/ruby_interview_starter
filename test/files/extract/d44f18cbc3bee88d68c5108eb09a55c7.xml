Print Kering reviews its brands&apos; sustainable development status Kering is more than ever committed to its engagement in favour of the environment. In February, the luxury goods group started a road show that will last until the autumn, visiting all of its brands, from fashion to jewellery, in France and Italy, in order to review their engagement in the field of sustainable development. It is a first of its kind, with the Kering boss himself on the front line. Marie-Claire Daveu- picture - photo Lea Crespi kering.com &quot;Together with François-Henri Pinault, we are meeting all of the brands&apos; executive committees, and the designers with their own teams, both to listen to them and to enjoy a real discussion with them on this issue,&quot; stated Marie-Claire Daveau, the group&apos;s Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of International Institutional Affairs, to FashionMag at the international meeting of the apparel and fashion world at the Hyères Festival in France.&quot;In November we will announce a new chapter in our engagement in favour of sustainable development. The idea behind these meetings with the brands is to see what can be done with a view to this second phase. For us it is a key moment of exchange with the people at the heart of the issue,&quot; said Daveau.&quot;The designers are highly motivated and very proactive in implementing this engagement. We have the ambition of scaling up our projects in this field. There is no future in the luxury industry without sustainable development,&quot; she concluded.While waiting to launch this new plan of action, Kering will make a statement on 3rd May &quot;on the status of our objectives related to the 2012-2016 plan.&quot; On the occasion, the group will start a conversation on social media, as it did last November on Twitter.The luxury, sport and lifestyle group has published last autumn the second edition of its annual environmental report.

AUSTIN, Texas - The veterinarian that made headlines after killing a cat with an arrow and bragging about it on Facebook is trying to keep her veterinary license. 
Kristen Lindsey and the Texas Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners are in Austin for an administrative hearing that is expected to last three days. 
The Board&apos;s Enhancement Committee recommended that Lindsey&apos;s license be revoked, but right now she is still able to actively practice as a vet. 
Lindsey will have a chance to provide her account of what happened and why she should be able to keep her license during that hearing in Austin. First photo of Kristen Lindsey since viral photo of cat. @KAGSnews #watchKAGS More tonight at 6. pic.twitter.com/ryBu2jcwFO 
In April 2015, Lindsey posted the picture to Facebook holding a cat that had been shot through the head by an arrow, but an Austin County Grand Jury did not have enough evidence to charge her with a crime . 
Lindsey was scheduled to appear on March 8th in front of an administrative law judge in the Texas State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH) to appeal her suspension, but instead the two sides tried to reach an agreement in mediation. 
An agreement was not made when the two went to mediation which has led to this week&apos;s hearing in Austin. 
KAGS anchor Tashara Parker is in Austin, and she will provide updates throughout the hearing. You can follow her on twitter and Facebook for updates as well.

NEW YORK (AP) - The Latest on financial markets (all times local): 
12:55 p.m. 
European stock markets have started off the new week the way they ended last - down. 
The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed down 0.8 percent at 6,260.92 while Germany&apos;s DAX fell 0.8 percent to 10,294.35. The CAC-40 in France ended Monday&apos;s session 0.5 percent lower at 4,546.12. 
Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said &quot;it looks like the risk-off atmosphere which characterized the end of last week has been turned up a notch today.&quot; 
He also cautioned that a much busier calendar over the rest of the week may be a trigger for more selling. Traders will be monitoring upcoming policy decisions from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan and a raft of earnings reports, from the likes of Apple and BP.

The British pound is buoyant in currency markets as traders think it&apos;s now less likely that the country will opt to leave the European Union in a referendum this summer following some tough talk from President Barack Obama. 
While visiting Britain over the weekend, Obama said any decision to leave could be costly and that it could ten years for the country to negotiate a trade deal with the United States. 
Worries over so-called Brexit have weighed on the pound in recent months. Now there&apos;s a growing expectation, partly on the back of Obama&apos;s comments that the British will opt to remain in the EU in the June 23 vote. 
Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com, thinks Obama&apos;s intervention in the debate has had &quot;a big impact.&quot; 
The pound was trading 0.6 percent higher at $1.4495.

European stock markets are drifting lower at the start of a week that&apos;s likely to be dominated by the central banks of the U.S. and Japan. 
Germany&apos;s DAX was 0.7 percent lower at 10,299 while the CAC-40 in France fell 0.5 percent to 4,549. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 0.2 percent lower at 6,295. 
Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, reckons it could be &quot;another rocky week&quot; in the markets as traders await and then digest the latest monetary policy decisions from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. 
There&apos;s also a raft of economic data towards the back end of the week that could also impact trading, notably eurozone growth and inflation figures. And the U.S. corporate earnings results season will also be monitored.

7:30 a.m. 
Asian stocks are lower across the board Monday ahead of policy decisions by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan as well as major earnings reports and economic data from Japan and China expected later in the week. 
Japan&apos;s benchmark Nikkei 225 dipped 0.8 percent to 17,439.30. South Korea&apos;s Kospi inched down 0.1 percent to 2,014.55. Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng fell 0.5 percent to 21,372.85, while the Shanghai Composite dropped 0.3 percent to 2,949.31. Trading was closed in Australia for ANZAC Day, a public holiday. 
Central bank policy meetings in Japan and the U.S. are the focus of investors&apos; attention. It is unclear whether additional monetary easing is in store, but the meetings may provide indicators for what can be expected on interest rates in the future. 
Benchmark U.S. crude fell 44 cents to $43.29 a barrel in New York. It lost 55 cents to $43.18 a barrel on Friday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 22 cents to $44.89. 
In currency markets, the dollar gained to 111.18 yen from 109.48 yen late Friday in Asia. The euro fell to $1.1243 from $1.1303. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

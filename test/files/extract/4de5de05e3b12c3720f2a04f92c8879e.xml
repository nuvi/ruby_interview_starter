SOURCE: The Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes April 25, 2016 12:52 ET Highball &amp; Harvest at the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes Celebrates BBQ and Beer on May 7th 
Cook Alongside &quot;Dr. BBQ,&quot; Learn From a Brewmaster and Enjoy a Special Dinner With Live Entertainment at the Luxury Orlando Resort 
  Barbecues and cold beers are synonymous with summer, and The Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes is pairing the favorites with two special events to kick off the season. 
On May 7, 2016, the luxury resort&apos;s Highball &amp; Harvest restaurant will host both a Big Brew &apos;n Que class and dinner, offering the chance to spend an entire day learning from the best and then sampling their craftsmanship. 
A team of BBQ experts, including Chef Jeremy Soares from Highball &amp; Harvest and &quot;Dr. BBQ&quot; Ray Lampe will be featured during a 6-hour class, held 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Many techniques will be shared for various smokers, including the versatile Big Green Egg grill. Lampe will be joined by Aaron Libera, Certified Cicerone ® and brewmaster for Whisper Creek Farm. Along with tips and information on home-brewing, Libera will also be brewing a recipe for the American Homebrewers Association&apos;s (AHA) National Homebrew Day, which is held every year on May 7 th . 
The day continues with a dinner on the Highball and Harvest lawn at 6 p.m. The event will feature live music and a variety of BBQ and grill stations, manned by our talented culinary team and &quot;Dr. BBQ&quot; himself. The brewmaster from Kansas City&apos;s Boulevard Brewing, John MacDonald will also be on hand pairing beers with each type of BBQ. 
The Big Brew &apos;n Que class can be reserved for $95 per person and includes BBQ and beer samples. The dinner is available for $85 for adults and $35 for children 12 and under; adults enjoy unlimited beer samples from 5:30 to 9 p.m. Just as BBQ and beer pair perfectly, one can also pair the class and dinner for $160 per person. Reservations are required for the class and highly recommended for the dinner, and can be made at 407-393-4422. 
Southern dishes are at the core of the menu at Highball &amp; Harvest, which takes its name from both the classic cocktail and the train conductor&apos;s signal (known as a highball) to depart at full speed; the latter was how produce made it from the field to the table. The Orlando restaurant pays homage to this past with an onsite garden, where ingredients are plucked and paired with those from local farms to create dishes and handcrafted cocktails. 
About The Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes Set amid 500 acres of natural beauty and bordered by Shingle Creek, The Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes offers an alternative experience in a city best known for its theme parks. While the latter are within easy reach, the luxury resort features exceptional amenities including an 18-hole golf course, 11 restaurants, a sprawling spa, programming for kids and teens and excursions that explore the surrounding Everglades. Inspired by the architecture of Italy&apos;s grand palazzos, the resort features 582 accommodations, including spacious guest rooms and luxurious suites.

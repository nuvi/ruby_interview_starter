Kona Kona less 
PORTLAND, Ore. – A man who was arrested in connection with a car theft and the death of the car owner’s dog named Kona was indicted on numerous charges, including animal abuse. 
Francisco Vincent Gonzalez, 34, stole a car belonging to Bill Robbins while it was running with the air conditioning on outside Robbins’ business on April 7, according to police. Robbins’ dog, Kona, was inside the vehicle and the theft was caught on surveillance video . 
&quot;It was pointless. He had so many opportunities to let my dog go,&quot; Robbins said. 
The car was found April 12 with Kona, a Great Dane and black lab mix, dead inside. Facebook Kona Kona less 
Gonzalez was arrested at a Portland motel on April 14. His wife, 33-year-old Linda Kathy Gutierrez, rented the room and was arrested at a different location, police said. 
A Multnomah County grand jury indicted Gonzalez for first and second-degree animal abuse, first and second-degree animal neglect, theft in the first degree, theft of a companion animal, unauthorized use of a vehicle, possession of a stolen vehicle, identity theft and possession of methamphetamine. 
Gutierrez was also indicted by the grand jury for hindering the prosecution. 
The couple is scheduled to appear in court Monday morning. 
Robbins told KGW he was glad the grand jury returned an indictment. 
&quot;I&apos;ll be at every hearing there is. I want to look at this guy in his face every single time. Let him know this is never going away.&quot; 
Kona’s remains were taken to the Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Oregon State University for a forensic examination, police said. Preliminary findings show Kona did not experience any trauma before he died. 
Robbins buried Kona in Southern Oregon. 
&quot;I appreciate all the help I&apos;ve been given. I really do,&quot; said Robbins. &quot;All the letters I&apos;ve been receiving. I appreciate it. They do make me cry but it allows me to really know people out there really do care about animals.&quot; 
Robbins&apos; supporters plan to hold a rally at Multnomah County Court on Monday at 9am.

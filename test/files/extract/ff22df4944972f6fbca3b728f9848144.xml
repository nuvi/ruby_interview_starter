Seattle Police are investigating after a church was vandalized and burglarized overnight. 
Someone spray-painted &quot;Go back 2 Africa&quot; on a wall inside Curry Temple C.M.E. Church on 23 rd Ave. and marked hallways with at least three large swastikas. 
A wall in the back of the church has a large &quot;n&quot; word spray-painted on it. 
Nearby storage rooms have been ransacked, with dishes and other church supplies broken and scattered on the floor. 
Church leaders believe a check book and debit card were stolen. 
Church members, visibly shaken by the slurs and damage, gathered Sunday morning to pray and comfort each other. 
&quot;This was about hurting and maybe terrorizing, but we’re not scared,&quot; said Rev. Beverly Jackson. 
She explained to the congregation that it&apos;s ok to weep, and to be angry, but their mission will not be disrupted by some writing on the wall. 
&quot;God sees the best in us,&quot; Jackson said.

I was happy, really! I had my talk accepted at the Italian Python Conference, and my employer agreed to send three more people with me. 
Three days with more than 500 geeks from abroad, world-class engineers, in the wonderful background of Firenze. 
Those were my feelings the morning of April 4th, before I fell on a step and broke my knee: hospital, surgery &amp; co. 
When I contacted the organization to free my talk slot, they say: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll miss you‚Ä¶ but not that much: you can make a screencast and we‚Äôll try to accomodate!‚Äù. 
The staff did a great work to setup the screencast and the hangout, while the audience was very sympathetic during some audio issues‚Ä¶ 
Needless to say how all that counted to me, stuck in bed, feeling the whole Lilliput army continuously pickaxing my knee üòâ 
I really love pycon.it being this: a community of people with formidable technical skills and a warm human touch.

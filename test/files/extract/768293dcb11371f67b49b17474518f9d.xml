Didn&apos;t recognized Dany at first? I mean come on, there are probably legends already about Khal Drogo and his silver haired khaleesi that hatched 3 dragons. The whole circling show that happened last season made me assume that they knew who she was and they wanted to bring her back to Vaes Dothrak. Otherwise why would they do that for a single stranded person and not kill/rape her right then and there? The way it was presented, it almost felt like it was done to showcase the Dothraki&apos;s comedy skills and to see her standing up to the khal. But of course, they don&apos;t get surprised that she is the Mother of Dragons (tm) but that she is Drogo&apos;s wife..

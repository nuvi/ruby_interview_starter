Did Ellen Pompeo Throw Shade at Patrick Dempsey on The Ellen DeGeneres Show? Comment Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 1:53 PM Updated at 4:18 PM Posted Apr 25, 2016 at 1:53 PM Updated at 4:18 PM Ellen Pompeo may have just thrown a subtle jab at her former Grey&apos;s Anatomy co-star/on-screen husband Patrick Dempsey . On Monday&apos;s episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show , DeGeneres asked Pompeo how things have been on Grey&apos;s in the wake of Dempsey&apos;s departure towards the end of last season. According to Pompeo, the answer is better than ever. &quot;It&apos;s amazing how much you get done without a penis,&quot; Pompeo responded. 13 reasons Dr. McDreamy made us swoon on Grey&apos;s Anatomy Pompeo later softened the blow, adding: &quot;We miss him dearly. But, yeah, the show is doing very well.&quot; The decision to kill off Dempsey&apos;s character , Derek Shepherd, was not well-received by many Grey&apos;s fans, to say the least. But in Pompeo&apos;s mind, change is for the better - and actually keeps people watching. &quot;I think a lot of people were really upset about his departure, which is super understandable,&quot; she told DeGeneres. &quot;But I think the change is part of the reason why the show goes on so long. I think they get so upset about the change, but change is precisely what everyone always needs to sort of get to the next place.&quot; Watch Pompeo&apos;s interview above.

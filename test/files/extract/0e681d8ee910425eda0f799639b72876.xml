 18 AM EDT Pneumatic Actuator Market 2016-2020 Industry exmined by Syndicate Market Research 
Pneumatic actuator is a device used to convert the energy sources into mechanical movements by using air pressure or compressed air. The energy sources used in pneumatic actuators are hydraulic fluid pressure, pneumatic pressure, electric current, etc. A Pneumatic actuator mainly made up of a valves or ports, piston and cylinder. Diaphragm pneumatic actuators, pneumatic power cylinders, gas-engine pneumatic actuators, turbine pneumatic actuators, etc., are the different pneumatic actuators. 
Growing demand for actuators from vehicles, minerals and metals are the major factors driving demand for pneumatic actuator. Rapid industrialization and advanced technology is expected to fuel the market growth in the years to come. However, increasing manufacturing cost and installation cost are expected to be major restraint of this market. The report also analyzes several driving and restraining factors and their impact on the market during the forecast period.

Dubai, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The lawyer for a prominent jailed Iranian artist and activist say authorities will soon free his client.
Mohammad Moghimi told The Associated Press Monday that an appeals court reduced Atena Farghadani’s 12-year prison sentence to 18 months and “she will be freed soon.”
Moghimi said the exact date for her release has not been set yet.
In June 2014, a court sentenced Farghadani, a cartoonist, over a cartoon that criticized a law limiting women’s access to birth control.

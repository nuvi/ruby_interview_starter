After 40 years, bike lanes on Bloor Street are still under consideration. 
It’s time to put them under construction, and let riders, drivers, business owners and everyone else who uses the east-west corridor decide if the lanes are worth keeping past the end of the summer. ENOUGH DEBATE. MT @680NEWS : Bike lanes on Bloor Street up for debate again at public works https://t.co/VxGN8KhQYB pic.twitter.com/ztG8pugQja

Yes, current Mayor John Tory loves a study, but even he cannot be blamed for the slow pace of the current transit project. 
Metro News reports the lanes were first proposed in 1976. Instead, bike lanes were installed on Harbord Street, lanes that are still in use to this day. 
As of 2014, 3,500 to 3,900 people biked along Harbord every day . Even without lanes, 3,000 cyclists use Bloor every day, according to City of Toronto data. 
That number will likely grow with protection. According to the City of Toronto’s own figures, the number of cyclists on Richmond Street more than doubled once dedicated lanes were installed (rising from 500 cyclists in June 2014 to 1,300 in May of 2015), and the number nearly tripled (from 550 cyclists in June 2014 to 1,575 in May of 2015) on Adelaide Street. 
About 25 years after the construction of the Harbord lanes, Toronto unveiled its 2001 Bike Plan . In that document, Bloor Street was touted as an ‘ideal east-west cycling route,’ for being flat and already popular with cyclists traveling in those directions. 
For context, babies that were born in 2001 are now in high school. There are still no bike lanes on Bloor. (The Harbord lanes were built three years before Prince released his first album.) 
A 2015 city report noted that “as far back as 1992, the City has commissioned multiple studies that have reviewed the opportunity of bike lanes on Bloor Street.” 
In 2015, cycling advocates could be forgiven for thinking they were closer to their decades-old goal: A CityNews.ca story boasted that “bike lanes are coming to Bloor Street West between Shaw Street and Avenue Road. The City of Toronto has given the green light to a one-year pilot project starting in 2016.” 
The current plan, up for debate at the public works committee on Monday , calls for lanes stretching from Shaw Street to Avenue Road. It also includes a separated bike lane and one lane of traffic in each direction. 
Toronto currently has an 856-kilometre bike network, with 558.4 kilometres of on-street lanes and 297.4 off-road trails. 
The lane on Bloor is part of a plan to add nearly 41 kilometres of new bike lanes to Toronto over the next 10 years. Bike lanes on two other major corridors, Yonge Street and Dupont Street, are also being considered.

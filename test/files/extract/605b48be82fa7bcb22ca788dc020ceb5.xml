CLEVELAND -- The Cleveland Cavaliers swept their way past a tough-minded Detroit Pistons squad in the first round of the Eastern Conference Playoffs, the Cleveland Indians finished off a three-game series with a win against the Detroit Tigers, and reports said former Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel has been indicted in Texas. 
Here are the top Cleveland sports headlines for Monday, April 25, 2016. 
CAVALIERS FINISH OFF SWEEP OF PISTONS 
The Cavaliers are moving onto the Eastern Conference Semifinals after completing a sweep of the Pistons with a 100-98 victory in Game 4 at The Palace of Auburn Hills Sunday night. 
Point guard Kyrie Irving led the Cavaliers to the victory by scoring a game-high 31 points after knocking down 12 of his 25 field-goal attempts and four of his 11 three-pointers, including a half-court look at the end of the third quarter and a pull-up triple from the right wing with 42 seconds to play in regulation. 
On a potential game-winning shot from Pistons guard Reggie Jackson, Irving bodied up the young veteran and forced the off-balance attempt, which was well off the mark. 
In addition to Irving, the Cavaliers got double-digit scoring efforts from shooting guard J.R. Smith, small forward LeBron James, power forward Kevin Love and reserve guard Matthew Dellavedova. 
James and Love tallied double-doubles of points and rebounds, as the prior scored 22 points and pulled down 11 rebounds to go along with his six assists and two steals, while Love tallied 11 markers and corralled 13 caroms. 
Smith buried five of his seven looks from three-point range on the way to 15 points, and Dellavedova added 11 for the Cavaliers, who have won five straight close-out games in the postseason. 
Four of Detroit’s starting five scored in double figures. 
INDIANS SWEEP WEEKEND SERIES WITH TIGERS 
The Indians’ bats came alive at Comerica Park, and that led to a three-game series sweep of the Tigers in Motown, which they finished off with a 6-3 win. 
The Indians strung together back-to-back three-run innings in the fourth and fifth frames that put the game out of reach. The heart of the order, second baseman Jason Kipnis, shortstop Francisco Lindor, left fielder Jose Ramirez and right fielder Marlon Byrd combined to go nine for 17 with six runs scored and four runs batted in. 
Kipnis went two for five with one run, while Lindor followed with a three-for-four slate with two runs and a walk. Ramirez was two for five with two runs scored and two driven in and Byrd belted two hits in three at-bats with two RBI. 
CARLOS CARRASCO HURT 
The Indians clinched the series sweep of the Tigers despite losing starting pitcher Carlos Carrasco to an apparent hamstring injury in the top of the third inning. 
Covering first base on Andrew Romine’s grounder to the right side of the infield, Carrasco appeared to slip slightly on his way to the bag, and after collecting the out, he fell to the ground and was writhing in pain. Carrasco had to be helped to the dugout after the play. 
In Carrasco’s absence, newly-minted reliever Trevor Bauer surrendered four hits and two earned runs with four strikeouts and one walk in 3.1 innings of work to earn the win. 
REPORTS: MANZIEL INDICTED BY GRAND JURY 
On Sunday night, reports surfaced that Manziel has been charged with misdemeanor assault, a grand jury decided after a Dallas Police investigation into a domestic issue with his former girlfriend, Colleen Crowley, that happened on January 30th. 
The initial investigation yielded no charges, but after Crowley filed an affidavit detailing the alleged incident, Dallas detectives took over the case. The investigation concluded in mid-March and was given to a supervisor for review of potential criminal charges. 
After the supervisory review, the Dallas Police Department turned the case over to a grand jury to determine if charges would be levied against Manziel. 
Prior to the announcement of charges, Crowley applied for and was granted an order of protection against Manziel after detailing the alleged assault in an affidavit in court seeking the order from a judge in Texas.

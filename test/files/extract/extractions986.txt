Local news Montclair Seniors celebrates 43 years Members are reminded that there will be no normal meeting next month as it is the annual lunch outing. 6 hours ago 
THERE was a good turnout for the Montclair Senior Citizens meeting held at the Methodist Church hall, where Alice cheerfully opened the meeting with devotions. 
Dave then welcomed all to the meeting to celebrate the club’s 43rd birthday. 
A special, warm welcome was given to the new member and the many visitors attending the meetin. The club hopes the visitors will have enjoyed the morning and will join as members soon. Those with birthdays this month were wished much happiness. Dave reminded those present that the club still needs a secretary and requested all to consider volunteering for this position. There is not much work involved. Numbers were then drawn for the raffle prizes and Colin shared a joke. Dave thanked all who had helped with the snacks and refreshment preparations. 
After enjoying the bumper spread on offer, the Bessie Williams choir entertained all with a variety of songs, including old favourites such as “Somewhere over the Rainbow’, ‘What a Wonderful World’, and ‘Hands Unite in Peace’. What a pleasure it was to listen to such talent. 
Members are reminded that there will be no normal meeting next month as it is the annual lunch outing. Members will meet at 10am on Thursday, 12 May at the Methodist Church for tea and those who have booked and paid will thereafter leave for the venue. SHARE

7 p.m. – Rain or Shine vs San Miguel (Rain or Shine leads series 1-0) Rain or Shine coach Yeng Guiao is hoping that the saying – third time’s a charm – will finally work for them as they go for a 2-0 lead against San Miguel Beer today in the Oppo-PBA Commissioner’s Cup at the Smart Araneta Coliseum. The Painters won the series opener, 98-94, despite the big numbers put up by SMB import Tyler Wilkerson, who fired 40 points, while June Mar Fajardo – the reigning back-to-back MVP – added 23 points and 13 rebounds. Rain or Shine import Pierre Henderson-Niles (hidden) strips the ball from San Miguel’s June Mar Fajardo while the Elasto Painters’ Jeff Chan looks in Game 1 of their PBA semifinal series at the Smart Araneta Coliseum. Rain or Shine won, 98-94. (Bob Dungo Jr.) 
“I don’t know if it’s going to push us winning the series,” said Guiao. “But the good sign is… ang ganda ganda ng nilalaro ni Wilkerson, ni June Mar but we were able to pull a win.” 
“I almost gave up on the guys but the guys did not give up on me. They proved their coach wrong. As great as their import was playing, as great as June Mar was playing, we pulled out a win.” 
“We’re looking forward to a series, which we might win this time,” said Guiao. 
The Elasto Painters are hoping to finally end their jinx against the Beermen after losing 3-1 in last season’s Governors’ Cup and 4-2 in this season’s Philippine Cup. 
San Miguel used those meetings to win the championship of both conferences. 
The 6-foot-10 Fajardo and the 6-foot-9 Wilkerson combined for 24-of-48 shooting performance from the field, but the other SMB mainstays struggled against the defense of Rain or Shine, particularly in the second period. 
Down by 18 points midway in the first period, and 40-50 at halftime break, the Painters rallied back behind their pesky defense, which resulted to SMB shooting a combined 35-of-88 (40%) from the field. 
SMB guard Marcio Lassiter finished with a miserable 1-of-9 from the field – his single basket came from the three-point territory, while point guard Alex Cabagnot went 6-of-15 to finish with 15 points. 
On offense, rookie guard Mav Ahanmisi took over in leading the team’s onslaught, scoring 23 points, while Jericho Cruz added 11 points and Jeff Chan had 10 points, including a crucial triple late in the game. 
ROS’s burly 6-9 import Henderson Pierre-Niles collected 13 points and nine rebounds, and was responsible in interrupting SMB’s offense especially the inside game led by Fajardo. San Miguel coach Leo Austria said they just have to execute their game plan and play for 48 minutes. “Nag-relax kami after kaming lumamang e, yung ang naging problema samin,” said Austria. “Kita naman na kaya naming lamangan e, kaso nung nag-relax na, nawala na kami. We’ll correct that issue.” “Also, other players will have to step up. I hope na maganda ang maging shooting namin overall as a team,” added Austria, whose team is aiming for a second straight title that will keep them on track for a second Grand Slam in franchise history after winning it in 1989.

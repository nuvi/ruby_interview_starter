 18 AM EDT Multirotor Drones Market 2016-2020 Industry exmined by Syndicate Market Research 
A multirotor is also known as multicopter is a rotorcraft with more than two rotors multiple rotors. A multirotor is a mechanically simple aerial vehicle, required for flight control, speeding or measuring multiple downward thrusting propeller units. Drone is also known as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A multicopter drone or UAV is capable of autonomous flight. Single and double rotor helicopter make use of complex variable pitch rotors to produce flight stability and control. Multirotor drones are widely used in various applications such as aerial shooting, defense, law enforcement, business &amp; commerce and environment inspection. 
Multirotor drones market is mainly driven by increasing use of drones in the law enforcement and for non-military applications like aerial shooting, agriculture, environmental inspection. Productivity, high precision, high efficiency, acceptable &amp; affordable innovations, and Cost-Savings or maintenance cost and technological advancements are the key factor of Multirotor drones market. However, declining defense budgets, lack of skilled pilots, and strict airspace regulations are expected to be major restraint of this market. The report also analyzes several driving and restraining factors and their impact on the market during the forecast period.

The report segments the multirotor drones market on the basis of payload, application and geography. Major Payload segments covered in this report includes wireless HD Video Transmission Systems, cameras, Electro-Optical Sensors, Wi-FI, Lidar, Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) sensors, Laser designators and sense &amp; Avoid/tracking system. Key applications of multirotor drones include aerial shooting, defense, law enforcement, business &amp; commerce and environment inspection. Among the all application segment business &amp; commerce dominated the multirotor drones market followed by law enforcement, defense application. 
On the basis of the geography, the multirotor drones market can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East and Africa with its further bifurcation into major countries including U.S., Germany, France, UK, China, Japan, India and Brazil. Asia-Pacific and the Middle East &amp; Africa was high investment in the research and development of the UAV sector. However, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East &amp; Africa are expected to grow at highest rate in multirotor drones market. 
In order to give the users of this report a comprehensive view on the multirotor drones market. The report includes detailed competitive scenario and product portfolio of key vendors. To understand the competitive landscape in the market, an analysis of Porter’s Five Forces model for the multirotor drones market has also been included. The study encompasses a market attractiveness analysis, wherein payload segments and applications segments are benchmarked based on their market size, growth rate and general attractiveness. 
The report provides comprehensive competitive analysis and profiles of prominent market players, such as Israel Aerospace Industries, DJI Innovations, AeroVironment, Inc., Microdrones GMBH, Aibotix, Draganfly Innovations, Cyberhawk Innovations Ltd., and Coptercam.

Baltimore Mayoral Candidates Make Final Push Ahead of Primary Day April 25, 2016 1:50 PM By Mike Schuh 
BALTIMORE (WJZ) — Less than 24 hours from now, the polls will open in Baltimore, and residents will start the process of deciding who will be the city’s next mayor. 
WJZ’s Mike Schuh followed some of the Democratic candidates this morning to find out how they’re feeling ahead of the big day.

That’s where Carl Stokes and Catherine Pugh could be found Monday morning. 
Stokes is not leading in the polls, but “we feel that people have changed their mind and are coming to the Carl Stokes campaign,” he told WJZ. 
Just a few feet away, frontrunner Pugh said private polls show her gaining traction, but she said she takes nothing for granted. 
“Doors are still being knocked and people are still being talked to and again, we are excited,” she said.

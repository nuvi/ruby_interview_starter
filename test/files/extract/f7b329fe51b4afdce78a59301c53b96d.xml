New Delhi, April 25: Cutting across political lines, the Parliamentarians today strongly disapproved the much-touted Odd-Even scheme of AAP government aimed at controlling pollution in the capital. 
A couple of them said they won’t follow it, one called the scheme ‘insulting’ while another lawmaker attacked the Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal by calling him ‘psychopath’. 
Here are the reactions by MPs who gave thumbs-down to Odd-Even scheme: 
1) Naresh Agrawal, Samajwadi Party (SP) 
The Delhi government did not exempt the MPs deliberately in order to insult them even as many others were exempted. Ever since the odd-even scheme has been launched, we are facing problems. 
Days are not far when rules will be framed to prescribe A and B will walk on the road on a particular day and C and D some other day. Only women will use the road one day and the next day only men. 
Agrawal wondered what will happen if the elected government of Delhi starts interfering in Lutyens’ Delhi. 
2) Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress leader 
Lawmakers should be exempted from the rule just for this Parliament session. 
Azad said many MPs have told him about inconvenience they were facing due to the scheme.

YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN... View gallery Award-winning BBQ is now available in Rancho Bernardo. Phil’s BBQ opened their newest location Monday at 17051 West Bernardo Drive, which is just off Interstate 15. While this is the fourth free-standing restaurant for the local chain, it is the first location developed with sustainability in mind. The most obvious example of sustainability at the new location is the large water tower, which is used for water reclamation. By storing and re-purposing the water, the restaurant can save gallons of water and reuse it to flush toilets and hydrate the drought resistant landscaping. The 7,720-square-foot site practices sustainability in other ways by using LED lighting, 100 percent energy star compliant appliances and dual glazed windows. Even with all of this change, Phil’s fanatics should not worry. The restaurant will still have features customers enjoy such as the BBQ focused menu, a full bar and giant televisions. Beyond this, the opening of the Rancho Bernardo location will bring 75 new jobs to the area and serve a population which did not previously have their own Phil&apos;s BBQ branch.

Undercover operation nets arrest, 2 pounds of meth 2016-04-25T17:36:10Z 2.2 pounds of meth investigators say they seized in a drug transaction (Source: Greene Co. Sheriff&apos;s Dept.) DeLeon Humberto Lopez (Source: Greene Co. Sheriff&apos;s Dept.) GREENE COUNTY, AR (KAIT) - 
A Jonesboro man faces felony drug trafficking charges after investigators say he sold 2 pounds of meth to an informant. 
On April 13, Captain Randy Sipes of the Greene County Sheriff’s Department, received word from an informant that DeLeon Humberto Lopez, 51, would deliver 2.2 pounds of meth in a few hours. 
Before meeting with Lopez, Sipes outfitted the informant with a hidden recording device then set up an undercover vehicle at the drop-off location to watch the transaction, according to the initial incident report. 
At the designated time, Lopez arrived at the location and placed a “large package” in the informant’s vehicle. 
According to the report, the package contained 2.2 pounds of suspected methamphetamine valued at $100,000. 
The informant’s recording device, the report stated, “captured every detail of the drug transaction and the possibility of additional illegal narcotics being delivered in the future.” 
Following the transaction, Lopez reportedly got into his car and drove away. 
Sipes decided not to arrest Lopez at that time; instead, he and a reserve deputy in another car “tandem-tailed” the suspect to his home in Jonesboro then “broke off the surveillance.” 
On April 21, a felony warrant for trafficking a controlled substance was issued for Lopez. 
After several failed attempts by the informant to contact Lopez, Sipes contacted the Second Judicial Drug Task Force in Jonesboro. 
At 11:30 a.m. that day DTF agents arrested Lopez at his home in the 400-block of North Bridge Street.

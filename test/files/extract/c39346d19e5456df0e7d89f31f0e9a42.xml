MONTREAL, QUEBEC--(Marketwired - April 25, 2016) - PyroGenesis Canada Inc. (http://pyrogenesis.com) (TSX VENTURE:PYR) (OTCQB:PYRNF), a TSX Venture clean-tech company (the &quot;Company&quot; or &quot;PyroGenesis&quot;) that designs, develops, manufactures and commercializes plasma waste-to-energy systems and plasma torch products, announces today that it successfully completed the factory acceptance test of six (6) plasma torches under its previously announced contract with Asian-based client (the &quot;Client&quot;) for the design, manufacture and delivery of a fully automated plasma torch system (the &quot;Contract&quot;). The testing was conducting at PyroGenesis&apos; facilities in Montreal in the presence of the Client and provided for the completion of the second phase of the Contract. The Client&apos;s name and origin remain confidential for competitive reasons. 
As previously noted, this US$2.2M Contract is for the delivery of a fully automated plasma torch system comprised of eight (8) air plasma torches to be used at the Client&apos;s waste-to-energy plant in Asia. PyroGenesis has received full payment for this second phase of the Contract, which includes the delivery of the remaining six (6) plasma torches and accessory equipment, with shipment of these units to be expected by the end of the current month. 
During the visit, PyroGenesis was asked to support the System start-up at its Client&apos;s plant in Asia and to supply additional spare parts and consumables. Furthermore, the Client expressed an immediate need for three (3) new multi-torch systems, with delivery expected as early as next year. 
According to BioEnergy Consult, a consulting and advisory organization specialized in biomass energy and waste-to-energy, the global market for biological and thermochemical waste-to-energy technologies is expected to reach US$29.2 billion by 2022. 1 The global waste-to-energy market, according to Transparency Market Research analysts, is anticipated to grow at a rate of 8.1 percent annually until 2019, with the Asia Pacific region now accounting for the largest part of the world market at 40%. 2 
&quot;With increased urbanisation in this part of the world, the need for sustainable waste management technologies is rapidly growing,&quot; said P. Peter Pascali, President &amp; CEO of PyroGenesis. &quot;In our efforts to meet the exact requirements of the US Navy, PyroGenesis succeeded in developing a robust, easy-to-operate plasma torch with an electrode life amongst some of the longest in the industry, and it is my belief that our proprietary plasma torch will serve as the backbone for next generation waste-to-energy systems for hazardous, industrial and municipal solid waste worldwide. This order and the anticipated re-orders from our Client are but a first step in this evolution.&quot;

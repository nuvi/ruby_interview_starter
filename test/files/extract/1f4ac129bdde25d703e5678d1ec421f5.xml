I recently named the 2015 film JOY one of the 7 most motivational movies for entrepreneurs and suggested (when the Star Wars reboot came out) that entrepreneurs should go see JOY instead . 
So, yeah, I&apos;m a fan of this movie. In fact, next week I&apos;ll be posting a podcast interview with Joy Mangano, the real-life entrepreneur played in the movie by the lovely and accomplished Jennifer Lawrence.

Two arrested after stealing pistol from Lubbock gun show Posted: April 25, 2016 - 11:15am A-J MEDIA 
A couple was arrested after stealing a firearm from a Lubbock gun show on Sunday afternoon. 
Lubbock police said 28-year-old Bryce Grantham and 24-year-old Brookly Edwards were arrested at the Silver Spur Gun and Knife Show at the Lubbock Memorial Civic Center, 1501 Mac Davis Lane, after they were observed stealing a 9MM semi-automatic pistol from a vendor at the show. 
The vendor, according to the report, told police Grantham concealed the gun in his pants and told Edwards, “Let’s get outta here, we gotta go.” Edwards assisted Grantham by concealing the theft with her body and purse. 
After the vendor confronted the couple, the report states, Grantham removed the pistol from his waistband after noticing a police officer standing near the exit. 
Lubbock police Lt. Ray Mendoza said the couple tried to evade on foot and were located in the parking lot. 
When police approached the suspects’ vehicle, the report states, officers noticed Grantham reclined all the way back in the passenger seat; Edwards was in the driver’s seat. 
Officers told Grantham to exit the vehicle; he failed to comply. Upon doing so, the officer noted, Grantham was then pulled out of the vehicle and continued to try to free himself from the officer’s grip. 
Edwards exited the vehicle, the report states, and was apprehended after resisting arrest. The gun was recovered and both suspects were transported to the Lubbock County Detention Center. 
Both Grantham and Edwards faced theft of a firearm and resisting arrest charges. 
Booking sheet information shows Grantham is being held on an estimated $3,500 bond. Edwards has since been released.

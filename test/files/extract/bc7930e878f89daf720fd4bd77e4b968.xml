We&apos;d love Nahki Wells to reach 20-goal target says Huddersfield Town boss David Wagner 19:05, 25 Apr 2016 The head coach says the striker has done a top job ths season Shares Get daily news by email Huddersfield Town&apos;s 18-goal top scorer Nahki Wells, left 
David Wagner says Nahki Wells’ Huddersfield Town teammates will do all they can to help the striker reach his 20-goal target. 
But it won’t be at the expense of the search for six points from the last two games of the Championship campaign. 
Wells is on 18 goals as Wagner’s 16th-placed side prepare for Saturday’s trip to Bristol City. 
The final game is at home to Brentford on Saturday, May 7, with a 12.30 kick-off for all second-tier games. 
Only one other Town player has reached the 20-goal mark in the last 10 years. 
Jordan Rhodes did it in 2011-12 (40 goals), 2010-11 (22) and 2009-10 (23). 
The last Town man to top 20 in a Championship campaign was Marcus Stewart , who netted 26 times in 1998-99. Click to play The Live Event you are trying to watch is either unavailable or has not started 
Wells – who made his 100th Championship appearance for Town in the 1-1 draw with Birmingham City – was on target last time he went to Bristol City, with Bradford City for a 2-2 League I draw in 2013-14, the season he joined Town for £1.3m. 
The club-record signing and Bermuda international has notched 39 Town goals in all. 
And Wagner said of the 25-year-old: “Nobody is allowed to expect 20 goals a season from a Huddersfield Town player. 
“We have to be realistic - with a club in the position we are in, such a mark would be unbelievable.

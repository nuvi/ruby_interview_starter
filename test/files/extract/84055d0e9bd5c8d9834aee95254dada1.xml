MANILA--Manila Electric Co. (MER.PH), the Philippines&apos; largest power distributor by sales, said Monday its first-quarter net profit rose 3% from a year earlier to 4.55 billion pesos ($97.8 million), with electricity consumption getting a boost from warmer temperatures due to the El Nino weather phenomenon.
Meralco, as the power distributor is better known, said that energy sales in the January-March quarter rose 12% to 9,077 gigaWatt-hours from 8,092 gigaWatt-hours in the same quarter of 2015.
But the gain in electricity consumption was tempered by the 8.4% on-year decline in the distribution rate, which is Meralco&apos;s main income source, to 1.42 pesos a kilowatt-hour from 1.55 pesos in the year-earlier period.
&quot;The economy is growing strongly,&quot; Oscar Reyes, Meralco president, told reporters in a briefing. &quot;Consumer spending has been helped by continued strong overseas Filipino workers&apos; remittance inflows and business process outsourcing earnings,&quot; he added.
He said the connection of new residential customers and the warmer temperatures in the first quarter--1 degree more than the comparable period last year--also helped increased consumption.
Customer count increased 3.8% on-year at the end of March this year to 5.84 million, around 92% of them residential users.
Capital expenditure in the first quarter dropped 66% on year to 1.19 billion pesos as Meralco awaited for regulatory approval for its capital outlay.

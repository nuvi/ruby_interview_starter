We are delighted to be hosting the second Pride of Mid Devon Awards because they present us with a fantastic opportunity – to celebrate local heroes. And we believe that&apos;s what local newspapers are all about. 
As part of our role of championing all that&apos;s great about our wonderful part of Devon, we&apos;re excited again to share the stories of our 2016 nominees who will go on to become finalists at our gala evening celebration. 
Devon has always produced a great many community-minded individuals and we&apos;ve been proud to share their campaigning and fundraising success stories over the years but, these days, with more cuts to services, we rely on these generous volunteers even more. 
We hope to be overwhelmed by a great number of entries across all categories so we can show these individuals and groups that we recognise their sacrifices and achievements and are overjoyed to have the chance to say thank you. 
I do hope you will join us in what promises to be an incredibly rewarding, emotional and uplifting evening. 
See you there.

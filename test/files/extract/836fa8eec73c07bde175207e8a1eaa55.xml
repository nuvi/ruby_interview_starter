A new startup is aiming to help people manage the moving process in a single app. 
MoveSnap acts like a personal moving concierge, guiding you step-by-step through everything that needs to be done, the company says. It covers everything from transferring home services such as hydro, gas, cable and Internet, to getting a new driver’s license, to connecting clients with local charities that will pick up items clients might not want to move to the new home. For each task, the app tells the user how to best get things done quickly and save time. 
The service also makes life easier for real estate salespeople by helping them address the often neglected post-deal experience, the company says. It replaces checklists or moving packages that agents might be using now, while allowing the agent and their brand to stay virtually engaged with the client well after the deal is signed. 
Toronto-based Re/Max Ultimate recently partnered with MoveSnap to help their clients avoid moving-related headaches. Tim Syrianos, broker/owner of Re/Max Ultimate, says he saw an opportunity to add value for his agents with the app. Syrianos also sees automating the moving process with MoveSnap as a way to increase the productivity of his agents and reduce the time they spend researching and answering moving-related questions, the company says. 
“Our business partners are our Realtors. Embracing the best technology to assist them to best represent their clients and be more efficient and productive is always our focus,” says Syrianos. 
Reuven Gorsht says he co-founded MoveSnap after having a nightmarish moving experience himself. 
“Buying a home is really exciting, but once reality sets in that you’ll have to move in a few weeks, that joy quickly turns into stress and frustration,” he says. “Moving is the worst part of the real estate transaction and is the last impression the client has.” 
He says for agents who add the app to their arsenal of tools, the outcomes can mean happier clients, who in turn, are happy to recommend the agent to their friends and family.

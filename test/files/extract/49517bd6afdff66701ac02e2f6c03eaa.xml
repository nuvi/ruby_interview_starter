This year for Oral Cancer Awareness Month, Herald Square Dental is encouraging prevention by performing oral cancer screenings during the last week of April 2016 at the reduced cost of $39* (regularly $96). Oral cancer does not discriminate according to age, race or gender. Early detection of oral cancer is most important because it provides a greater chance that treatment will be successful.
Symptoms include non-healing sores and growths and patches on oral tissues, gums or the tongue. Herald Square Dental ’s professionals will use Velscope screening exams to detect these abnormal cells before they develop into sores or lesions. Velscope screens for abnormal changes in the oral tissues so they can be treated before they develop into something more serious.
Herald Square Dental feels strongly about prevention and has been offering oral cancer screenings for years. To prevent oral cancer, Herald Square Dental suggests visiting a dentist every six months for a routine checkup that includes an oral cancer screening and adjunctive oral cancer screening with Velscope.

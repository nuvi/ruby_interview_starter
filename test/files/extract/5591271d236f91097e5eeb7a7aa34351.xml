Via imgflip.com If you need to vent, don’t talk to other parents. That’s worst thing you can do. Talk to that compassionate office mate of yours without kids. They won’t say “When my kid was that age, we (fill in the blank with useless story).” They’ll nod with empathy and let you talk. We all have nieces, nephews and friends with kids. We understand you are going through a lot and we’ll help you get back into the swing of things without unsolicited advice. ID: 8501249 1. Don’t over commit and slow the rest of us down. You’re still learning how to do this “mom thing.” Via imgflip.com You were awesome before the baby and you’ll want to kick ass again. But, when you commit to deadlines, be careful. Be realistic to what you can accomplish on 3 hours of sleep. After all, think of how many pre-baby times you covered for the hungover IT programmer or your boss who left early to go golfing. Take a turn being the slacker for once. ID: 8501253

Women Faculty Forum presentation May 9 Share Tagged awards , faculty , forum , Hebl , women Dr. Michelle Hebl 
The Women Faculty Forum invites the McGovern Medical School to attend a seminar and awards presentation Monday, May 9. 
Dr. Michelle Hebl , professor of psychology and management at Rice University, will present on “Gender Bias in the Workplace.” Her talk will be at 4:30 p.m. in MSB 3.001, followed by a presentation of Excellence Awards. 
An applied psychologist whose research focuses on issues related to diversity and discrimination, Hebl examines subtle ways in which discrimination is displayed and how such displays might be remediated by individuals and/or organizations. 
Hebl is the recent recipient of the 2016 Cherry Award for Great Teaching from Baylor University. She has received dozen awards for teaching and her work on issues of gender and diversity, including Rice University’s George R. Brown Prize for Superior Teaching (2002, 2004, 2005, 2010 and 2012); the Distinguished Teaching Contributions Award from the Society of Industrial/Organizational Psychology (2008); Rice’s Julia Miles Chance Prize for Excellence in Teaching (2005); and The Sage Award for Scholarly Contribution (2014), a lifetime award from the “Gender and Diversity in Organizations” Division at the Academy of Management.

Commentary Main events An interesting stat to note, as today’s fixture marks the league’s youngest team - Tottenham, with an average age of 25 - taking on the top flight’s oldest in the shape of West Brom, whose average age is just over 30. Will youth or experience triumph this evening? As mentioned, Tottenham’s young star Alli was rewarded for his stunning debut season in the Premier League with one of the mosts prestigious awards at the PFA event on Sunday evening, with Leicester’s Riyad Mahrez having scooped the Player of the Season gong. The 20-year-old England midfielder, signed for under £5million from MK Dons last January, has scored 11 times and amassed a further 10 assists across all competitions this campaign from playing in a free-role behind the excellent Harry Kane. Included in those goals is his wonderfully-taken volleyed-effort in the reverse fixture at The Hawthorns back in December - though James McClean’s goal earned Pulis’ side a share of the spoils on that occasion. TEAM NEWS - West Brom substitutes: Sandro, Roberts, Chester, Anichebe, Palmer, Lambert, Leko. TEAM NEWS - West Brom (4-3-3): Myhill; Dawson, McAuley, Olsson, Evans; Gardner, Yacob, Fletcher; Sessegnon, Rondon, McClean. TEAM NEWS - Tottenham substitutes: Davies, Vorm, Chadli, Mason, Trippier, Son, Carroll. TEAM NEWS - Tottenham (4-2-3-1): Lloris; Walker, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Rose; Dier, Dembele; Lamela, Alli, Eriksen; Kane. As for the visitors, Pulis has made four changes in total. With Ben Foster ruled out through injury, Boaz Myhill comes back in to start between the sticks, while Jonas Olsson and Craig Gardner also return. Saido Berahino, heavily linked with a move to Tottenham throughout both of the previous two transfer windows, is also absent, with West Brom’s top-scorer Salomon Rondon starting up front. It looks to be a 4-3-3 system for Pulis, though the wingers are likely to drop deep and look to play on the counter rather than remain further upfield. Let’s check on the line-ups, starting off with the hosts... The team news is in from White Hart Lane and, unsurprisingly, Pochettino has made no alterations to the Tottenham side that hammered Stoke 4-0 at the Britannia Stadium this time last week. That means that it is the third-successive game he has retained the same line-up, which includes the newly-crowned PFA Young Player of the Year Dele Alli, along with fellow PFA Team of the Year members Toby Alderweireld, Danny Rose and Harry Kane - who has netted three goals in three Premier League games against the Baggies and is only two away from having notched 50 times in the top flight. Though their overall record against Tottenham is poor, West Brom have only suffered one defeat in their last five Premier League visits to White Hart Lane. They sit in 14th on 40 points, and can almost certainly count themselves secure in terms of their immediate future in the top-flight. However, they come into this game on the back of a five-match winless streak, in which they have lost four of those fixtures - the last of which was a 2-0 defeat to Tottenham’s north-London rivals Arsenal last Thursday. Tony Pulis certainly has form when it comes to halting a title charge, though, having been the man in charge of Crystal Palace when they came from three goals down to pin Liverpool back to a 3-3 draw when Brendan Rodgers’ side looked set to ease their way to a first league crown since 1990. Based on the respective fixtures remaining for the two title challengers in this truly incredible season, Pochettino’s men certainly appear to have the toughest set. Following tonight’s clash against a West Brom side they have only lost once to in their last 12 league meetings, they make the short trip across the capital to face Chelsea before hosting Southampton and then, on the final day, travelling up to St James’ Park to take on Newcastle United – who, it seems likely, are set to take their relegation scrap with Norwich City and Sunderland – right to the wire. All of this makes this evening’s encounter even more vital for the Lilywhites if they are to keep the dream of securing their first title in 55 years alive. While this weekend’s results have guaranteed a new name on the Premier League trophy – with both Arsenal and Manchester City now mathematically out of the hunt – the run-in is still set to be wracked with drama. Tottenham have conceded just twice in their unbeaten run of six league fixtures, and claimed convincing victories over Manchester United and Stoke City in their last two outings. Hello and welcome, football fans, to our LIVE coverage of this vital clash in the Premier League title race, as second-placed Tottenham host West Brom at White Hart Lane. With Leicester City’s victory over Swansea City on Sunday lifting Claudio Ranieri’s side eight points clear at the top, Mauricio Pochettino’s men must win tonight to prevent the Foxes being able to clinch their first-ever top-flight title when they face Manchester United at Old Trafford this coming weekend.

New Delhi, April 25: India’s star batsman Virat Kohli said on Monday he is looking forward to watching the biopics of iconic Indian cricketers Sachin Tendulkar, Mohammad Azharuddin and Mahendra Singh Dhoni which are scheduled to be released soon. 
Batting legend Tendulkar has recently released on his social networking sites the teaser of his biopic, “Sachin: A Billion Dreams”, whereas Bollywood actor Emraan Hashmi plays the role of Azharuddin in movie named “Azhar”. Actor Sushant Singh Rajput plays Dhoni in a film named “M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story”. 
“I am looking forward to watch all of them. Obviously, the one I am waiting for the most is Tendulkar’s. It is because I am connected with Tendulkar’s memories for such a long time, from when I was a child,” Kohli said. 
“Actually to get into his head, as I have idolised him from the beginning. What has happened in his career will be portrayed in that. I am really looking forward to it,” Kohli said at the launch of Virat FanBox in partnership with Privyplex here. 
The 27-year-old batsman has been in sublime form of late, bagging the man of the tournament award in the recent World Twenty20 event and is currently the leading run scorer (367 runs) in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL). 
“Again the other two biopics, MS as well… his journey has been very very different one. But there are lots of instances that you won’t understand in a cricketer’s life. And the third one, Azharuddin as well, the instances that has happened in his life.” RELATED NEWS

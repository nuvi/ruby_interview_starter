Ex-Lee County Circuit Clerk Sentenced, Fined - LEX18.com | Continuous News and StormTracker Weather Member Center: Ex-Lee County Circuit Clerk Sentenced, Fined Posted: Updated: 
A former Lee County Circuit Clerk was sentenced last week in Franklin Circuit Court after pleading guilty in February to abuse of public trust. 
Emma Adams was sentenced Friday, to five years’ probation and 180 days of home incarceration. As part of sentencing, the judge imposed a fine of nearly $335,000. 
Adams also must pay the remaining balance of restitution, which is nearly $79,000. She paid $156,000 in restitution in February when she pled guilty. Adams will pay $2,500 in restitution monthly. 
Adams unlawfully obtained more than $100,000 in public money or property from funds that were administered through the Administrative Offices of the Court (AOC). 
With assistance from AOC auditors, the Office of the Attorney General’s Department of Criminal Investigations began investigating Adams. 
The investigation traced and verified a total of $334,845.44 in missing state funds from 2006 until mid-year 2015. Nearly $78,738.97 of the missing funds was from circuit civil filing fees, which was administered solely by Adams. 
The remaining $256,106.47 was traced to missing bank deposits. Those funds represent money the circuit clerks are required to take in and hold in trust on behalf of others such as bail bonds and restitution payments. WEATHER

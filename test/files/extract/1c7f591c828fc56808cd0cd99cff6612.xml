LMDC: Jail conditions lead to moving inmates to unused 1950s jail WHAS11.com Staff , WHAS 12:22 PM. CDT April 25, 2016 Louisville Metro Corrections CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST 
LOUISVILLE (WHAS11) – The Louisville Metro Department of Corrections said jail conditions are becoming crowded as the inmate population is trading above 2,000, daily bookings are above historical numbers and the scheduled movement of state felons from jail to prison has slowed down. 
LMDC said there are only 1,793 fixed jail beds and many inmates are sleeping on temporary bunks. The working conditions are also tougher for officers. 
According to LMDC, there is no room left in the Main Jail Complex at 400 S. 6th Street, no space left at the Hall of Justice at 6th and Jefferson and no more beds available at the Community Correctional Complex at 316 E. Chestnut Street. 
Metro Corrections Assistant Director Steve Durham said there is no immediate way to rapidly reduce the number of inmates committed to Metro Corrections custody. 
In order to alleviate the situation, the Metro Corrections Director Mark Bolton, has ordered that dozens of inmates will be moved to a 1950’s jail that sits above the Louisville Metro Police Department. It is currently not being used. About 75 minimum custody inmates will be moved in the first wave on April 25. 
“We have readied Corrections Officers, medical staff, and the kitchen as well as all other operations partners for this decision. This is an uneasy decision that will create an unbudgeted expense of about $60,000.00 a month,” said Metro Corrections Dir. Bolton. “But we cannot ignore the challenge crowded housing units present for Corrections Officers and for inmates living in existing overcrowded conditions. As I said in the past, this is a temporary overflow mechanism. When faced with this type of overcrowding concerns I will not hesitate to use the shuttered jail. I will use it safely and I will shut it down as quickly as conditions allow.” 
This is the third time Metro Corrections has safely moved inmates into the old jail since 2012. If fully utilized, Metro Corrections can have as many as 140 inmates in this area at a cost of approximately $110,000.00 per month.

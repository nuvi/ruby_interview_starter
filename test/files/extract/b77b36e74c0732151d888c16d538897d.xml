Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany declares himself 100 per cent fit to face Real Madrid Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale celebrate a Real Madrid goal 
Monday, April 25, 2016 
Vincent Kompany says he is fully fit and raring to go against Real Madrid on Tuesday night. 
The Manchester City skipper has struggled with calf problems throughout the season and has made just one appearance in the last five weeks. 
But Kompany, who did not feature in Saturday&apos;s 4-0 win over Stoke in the Premier League , is ready to lead the team out against the mighty Real in the first leg of their last-four tie at the Etihad Stadium. 
Asked about his fitness level at City&apos;s pre-match press conference, the Belgian said: &quot;100 per cent. Everything went well. When you are injured you have to work a lot harder than the rest and that is what I did. 
&quot;People talk about my injuries but I talk about my comebacks. That is what I have in my head. People talk about 14 injuries to my calf and I talk about 14 times I have come back and played like I have never been away. It takes a lot of strength of character to do that.&quot; 
City face a formidable challenge to reach their first ever Champions League final. 
Real have won the competition a record ten times and boast an array of superstars - Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale among them. 
But Kompany says his side are relishing the showdown with the Spanish giants and cannot wait for Tuesday night. 
&quot;When you get to the semi-final, there is nothing bad for you anymore, you just want to play,&quot; he said. 
&quot;The whole squad has been positive and it has lifted us in the Premier League. It has given us something important to look forward to. If you are not hungry tomorrow, you never will be.&quot;

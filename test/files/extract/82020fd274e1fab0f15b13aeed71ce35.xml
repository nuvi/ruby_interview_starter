Correction: China-Ford Pickup story - KFDA - NewsChannel 10 / Amarillo News, Weather, Sports Member Center: 2016-04-25T17:43:21Z 2016-04-25T17:43:21Z 
DETROIT (AP) - In a story April 22 about Ford Motor Co. selling its F-150 pickup in China for the first time, The Associated Press reported erroneously - based on incorrect information from Ford - that the Ford Ranger pickup is sold in China. 
A corrected version of the story is below: 
For the first time, Ford&apos;s F-150 pickup truck will be sold in China. 
Ford Motor Co. said Friday that it&apos;s bringing the beefy, off-road version of its F-150 - the F-150 Raptor SuperCrew - to China next year. 
The Raptor has been popular in China&apos;s gray market, where buyers are known to pay triple the list price. But it&apos;s never been officially sold in the country. 
Ford introduced the Raptor in 2009 and it quickly gained a following among off-road enthusiasts. It was discontinued in the 2014 model year as Ford prepared to launch a new, aluminum-bodied F-150. 
The new version of the Raptor goes on sale later this year. It has a more powerful 3.5-liter V6 EcoBoost engine, a new 10-speed transmission and a terrain management system for driving in sand, rocks or snow. Its aluminum body also makes it faster and lighter. 
Ford didn&apos;t announce pricing, but the Raptor is expected to start around $50,000. Chinese buyers will face additional import duties, since the truck will be built in Dearborn, Michigan. 
The automaker makes multiple versions of the F-150, but it only plans to send the Raptor to China for now. The F-150 pickup is sold in 95 countries - and has been one of the best-selling vehicles in the U.S. for three decades.

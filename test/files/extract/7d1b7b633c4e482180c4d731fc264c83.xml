Suhr, Blake among Rio contenders to compete in Boston Reuters Facebook (Reuters) - Rio Olympic medals contenders Jenn Suhr, Meseret Defar, Yohan Blake and Nick Willis are among top athletes expected for the inaugural adidas Boost Boston Games on June 17-18, organizers said on Monday. 
The international meet, which replaces the adidas Grand Prix Diamond League meeting that had been held in New York City, will climax on Saturday in a &quot;street meet&quot; held on historic Charles Street between the Boston Public Garden and Boston Common. 
American Suhr is the 2012 Olympic women&apos;s pole vault gold medallist and world indoor record holder, and Ethiopia&apos;s Defar is a six-times IAAF world champion, two-time Olympic gold medallist and former world record holder at 5000 meters. 
New Zealander Willis is the 2008 Olympic silver medallist at 1500 meters, while Jamaica&apos;s Blake is the 2011 IAAF world champion at 100 meters and 2012 Olympic silver medallist at both 100 meters and 200 meters. 
Blake also owns two world records as a member of Jamaica’s 4x100 meters and 4x200 meters relay teams. His personal best of 9.69 seconds equals the second-fastest time ever for 100 meters, and his 19.26 is second-fastest ever at 200 meters.

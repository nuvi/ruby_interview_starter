EMN Dimapur, April 25 
Nagaland Pradesh Congress Committee (NPCC) said that it has always endeavoured to solve the political problem through peaceful and constitutional means that will bring about a good solution but it does not subscribe to personal opinion of KV Pusa who is facing disciplinary proceedings for ideological differences with Indian National Congress. “His view of blaming NPGs for not uniting and talking with GoI only proves that he is unconscious of the situation.” On the issue of unity, NPCC said, enough has been said and done. NPCC Media Cell in a statement said, “We are all aware of the difficulties; however we have not lost hope despite their (NPGs) differences. Whether they unite or not, when they start talking with GoI, they will be talking on the same agendas, for GoI will not have different agendas for different NPGs. NPCC is clear that the matter is pending with GoI and not with NPGs. We all know that barring NSCN (IM), other NPGs are waiting for GoI to open its door for official talks.” NPCC said, “In our view, the agendas should be initiated by the people; for people have given absolute mandate under plebiscite of 1951 for a noble political cause. No faction or group has the authority to change the plebiscite without referendum. It is only referendum that can change the agenda. In the present situation, we must acknowledge the reality that the days of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru are no more. The government of the day at the centre has one agenda and that is Hindutva.” The NPCC however said, the agreement signed between GoI and NSCN (IM) on Aug 3, 2015 which is called Naga Accord or Framework Agreement should not vanish in thin air as Rahul Gandhi has responded to Prime Minister Modi in the parliament. “The evening of signing Accord, Modi had called up Madam Sonia Gandhi and proclaimed that he had solved the Nagaland problem, and has signed a historic accord. Modi also called up other senior opposition leaders and told them he had achieved what Congress could not achieve in 40 years. Unfortunately, the impact is yet to be felt on ground. Modi should live up to his words since he has been promising moon and stars to the people.” “It was only Rahul Gandhi who had raised the issue questioning Modi, but he has not responded so far, since he is surely in a dilemma after the initial euphoria. On the other hand; if the state Govt is sincere and has the courage to propose agendas in the manner of Nagaland People’s Convention (NPC) and willing to take the responsibility before the people, GoI surely will respond. However, with due respect to 60 MLAs, their best effort is just limited to facilitate and support.” “In recent times, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh had said that GoI is ready to talk to any insurgent group within the constitutional limits, if they lay down arms without any conditions. So it appears the beginning is yet to be made.” Related posts:

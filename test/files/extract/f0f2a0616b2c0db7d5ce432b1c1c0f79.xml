Paul Gauguin Cruises has expanded its land-and-sea packages so that guests have a choice of combining two nights at the InterContinental Tahiti Resort &amp; Spa or the InterContinental Moorea Resort &amp; Spa with a 7-night Tahiti &amp; the Society Islands voyage. The package also includes roundtrip airfare between Los Angeles, Calif., and Papeete, Tahiti. 
After arriving in Papeete, guests check into their lagoon-view room at the InterContinental Tahiti Resort &amp; Spa or take a short ferry ride to the InterContinental Moorea Resort &amp; Spa, where a lanai room awaits. Then, they enjoy two nights with daily breakfast at the property. Upgrades to an overwater lagoon bungalow are also available for an additional cost. 
Following the luxury hotel stay, guests are transferred to The Gauguin for a 7-night roundtrip Tahiti &amp; the Society Islands voyage. From Papeete, the ship sails to the scenic islands of Huahine, Bora Bora, and Moorea. A highlight of the cruise is a day spent at Motu Mahana, Paul Gauguin Cruises&apos; private islet off the coast of Taha&apos;a, which features a barbecue feast, watersports, Polynesian activities, and cocktails from full-service and floating bars. Guests also enjoy exclusive access to a private white-sand beach in Bora Bora with stunning views of Mt. Otemanu.

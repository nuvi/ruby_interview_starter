Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speaks to a crowd of thousands in Baltimore on Saturday. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post) HARTFORD, Conn. — Ahead of Connecticut’s Democratic primary Tuesday, Bernie Sanders is taking aim at the state’s Democratic governor for recent cuts to mental health services. 
At a rally here Monday morning, Sanders chided Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, who has endorsed Hillary Clinton, for a recent package of budget cuts that included funding reductions for mental health services.
“Now I don’t want to get too involved in local government here in Connecticut, but I understand that your governor has been cutting mental health treatment,” the senator from Vermont told a crowd of about 1,800 at a riverfront park here, eliciting a round of boos.
[ Facing long odds for the Democratic nomination, Sanders remains a big draw on the trail ] 
“We need to revolutionize mental health treatment in this country,” Sanders said. “We need more treatment, more counselors, and I would hope very much the governor will rethink the wisdom of cutting mental health workers in the state of Connecticut.” 
The Democratic presidential hopeful made similar comments at a rally Sunday night in New Haven, which drew more than 14,000 people to a downtown park, according to parks officials.
Last month, Malloy announced a nearly $7.2 million cut in funding for Connecticut’s Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services as part of a wide-ranging package of mid-year budget reductions to address a projected state deficit.
[ Sanders: Support for Clinton ‘totally dependent’ on how progressive her agenda is ] 
Malloy, meanwhile, while campaigning for Clinton, has sharply questioned Sanders’s record on guns, including a 2005 vote to provide legal immunity to gun dealers and manufacturers when their products are used to commit crimes.
The sparring between the two comes amid questions about how much Sanders would seek to do to unify the party if Clinton becomes the Democratic nominee.
It also highlights one big advantage Clinton enjoys in the race: overwhelming support from the Democratic Party’s elected officials.
Clinton has accumulated more delegates than Sanders in the Democratic primaries and caucuses. But her advantage is magnified because of her lopsided lead in the announced support of superdelegates, the elected leaders and other Democratic insiders who have a say on the nomination but are not bound to follow the will of their state’s voters.
Clinton’s current lead among superdelegates is 513 to 38, according to an Associated Press tally.
Sanders has tried to make a virtue out of running against the “establishment,” but more recently he and his advisers have acknowledged the need to woo more superdelegates if he is to have a shot at the nomination.

Seems like Sanders has become drunk with the wine of mass adoration from his followers and now feels empowered to attack the party he joined in order to make a hail mary campaign bid. Top that off with the Rosario Dawson&apos;s reference to Monica Lewinsky this past weekend and what you get is a grumpy granddaddy playing deep dirty and destructive. I don&apos;t agree with the governor cutting funding for the mentally ill, but cutting him down publicly just to get at Clinton is a bit underhanded. This election is much too important to get bogged down intra-party petty bull-quip.

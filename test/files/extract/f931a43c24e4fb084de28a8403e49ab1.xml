Muscular dystrophy charity unveils hoist chair From left, Paul Orme, Steph Leech and Gill Story 0 comments 
A WINSFORD charity that treats people with a muscle wasting condition has unveiled a hoist chair thanks to a donation from a national estate agent. 
Gascoigne Halman shared a £715 slice of their £25,000 community challenge fund with the Neuromuscular Centre in Winsford. 
The Neuromuscular Centre (NMC) provides support and treatment for people with muscular dystrophy, a progressive muscle wasting condition that affects thousands of people every year. 
It is a one of a kind facility in the UK and Europe, and aims to improve the lives of people with neuromuscular conditions. 
Lyndsey Cannon-Potts, head of fundraising at the NMC, said: “Ongoing physiotherapy isn’t provided by statutory sources for individuals with a lifelong progressive condition, however it is a proven tool for slowing the progressive nature of the condition.” 
Gascoigne Halman celebrated their 25th anniversary by setting up a £25,000 fund to support good causes. 
Their aim was to select charities and community groups that create a positive impact on the community while providing long-term benefits for the area. 
Mrs Cannon-Potts said: “It’s so important for us to replace the hoist chair as it enables our members to access the pool, which they enjoy so much. 
“We are delighted to receive this donation and can’t thank Gascoigne Halman enough.” Share:

Prime Minister hopes for productive Parliament session 25 Apr 2016, 1207 hrs IST , AGENCIES As the second half of the Budget session got underway, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday (April 25) hoped that members of all parties will discuss issues in a democratic spirit and take good decisions. With Opposition, mainly the Congress planning to target the government over imposition of President&apos;s Rule in Uttarakhand, Modi hoped that members will involve themselves in free discussions like the last time and important decisions will be taken. He noted that the the first part of the Budget session was very productive and several important legislations were passed. &quot;The first part of the Budget session was very productive. All the parties helped in running Parliament smoothly and many important decisions were taken. And the MPs of all parties seemed happy about this. This time too we will discuss issues with similar enthusiasm and as per the tradition of democracy and take good decisions. This is my belief,&quot; he said. Even as the government has listed a heavy agenda for the session, including passage of 13 bills in Lok Sabha and 11 bills in Rajya Sabha, there is understanding among its floor managers that pushing contentious measures like GST won&apos;t be possible in first few days. Congress backed by the Left, JD(U) and other opposition parties, is determined to corner the Centre over imposition of President&apos;s rule in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh, calling it an &quot;assault&quot; on the federal structure. The NDA government is likely to counter the attack citing instances of imposition of President&apos;s rule when Congress governments or governments backed by it or other Opposition parties were in power at the Centre.

Workshop: Shinto Ritual Rope Making Sun, Apr 24, 11:00 AM 
Join artist Edward Schocker and ensemble members as they talk about the significances and history of rope making in various aspects of our life. Shimenawa are lengths of laid rice straw rope used for ritual purification in the Shinto religion. Shimenawa rope sometimes has a bell attached to the top of the rope that makes sound as the rope is shaken. This helps call to spirits and purifies the space. For their project, The Crossing , join them as they make Shimenawa ropes that will be installed in YBCA’s lobby for the New Frequencies Festival and activated during the premiere of The Crossing . 
The workshop will be held from 11 AM–1 PM.

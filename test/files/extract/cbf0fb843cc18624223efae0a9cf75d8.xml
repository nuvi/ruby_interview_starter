A NEWPORT man, who hid a firearm under his testicles, has been sentenced to two years and four months in prison for offences. 
Moyied Bashir, 24, of Maesglas Crescent, pleaded guilty to all charges against him – the production, supply and possession of a class A drug, possessing criminal property, and the possession of a prohibited weapon, at Newport Crown Court. 
The drug offences against Bashir all related to crack cocaine, while the criminal property was £2,700 in cash belonging to another individual, and the firearm was a PAVA spray canister. 
The court heard how a flat occupied by Bashir, who was arrested on January 20, 2015, was filled with items used to create crack cocaine, including a Bunsen burner and ammonia. 
Prosecuting, Jason Howells told the court that despite the small level of crack cocaine made by Bashir, text messages sent between January 1, 2014, and January 21, 2015, showed the scale of the ‘very, very small’ operation. 
Mr Howells said: “The flat were you were residing was searched, and the Ford Mondeo which belonged to you, which provide showed traces of ammonia. 
“A small silver clip was found after your arrest, hidden beneath your testicles, which contained the PAVA spray canister. This is often used by persons involved in drugs for protection.” 
PAVA is approved only for police use in the UK, and is prohibited under section five of the Firearms Act 1986. 
Mr Howells added that Bashir had two previous convictions, from 2012 and 2013, relating to possession of cannabis, and one for criminal damage from 2009. 
Defending, Gareth Williams told the court that Bashir had turned his life around since moving back in with his parents, acting as a carer for his mother. 
He said: “He has been offered employment and in essence, he has turned his life around. 
“Since his arrest, he has committed no further crimes and he has said that he does not want to go back to his previous life.” 
Summing up, Patrick Curran QC said: “It seems to me the part you played in the production of the drugs affects the length of the sentence. 
“The text messages show that this is a serious matter.” 
Bashir received a concurrent sentence of two years and four months, for which he will serve one year and two months in prison. 
He will then be released on licence. 
The judge also ruled that an appropriate surcharge will be paid, if applicable upon his release. Share:

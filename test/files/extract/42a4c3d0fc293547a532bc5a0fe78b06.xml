Attractive red tri Mini American Shepherd. Fun and active. Crate trained and loves to go for walks. Not a city dog. He will be a sweet companion, but would not be happy in a suburban area. He is a country dog. Not accustomed to traffic and city life.only would go to a fenced backyard.Possibly a stock competition dog. Micro-chipped.Price is on a limit certification.

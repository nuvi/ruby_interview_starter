Not really. That’s because I would not, in my wildest imagination, have imagined it could happen. 
There is a movie on Florence Foster Jenkins. Even more amazing, it is titled Florence Foster Jenkins . 
It doesn’t ring a bell, does it? 
It rang a bell for me. 
In 1956, I was working at a record store. It was my first regular job. Another employee, Lype O’Dell, who later became an actor, recommended that I listen to a 10-inch LP record. It was titled simply, Florence Foster Jenkins . The cover was a tipoff, but I was naïve. I did not see what was coming. Then he put it on the turntable and had me listen. I could not believe my ears. 
I read the liner notes. She was accompanied by pianist Cosme McMoon. That seemed reasonable at the time. It still does.

They were replaced in 1957 by Jonathan and Darlene Edwards, who produced a series of five albums over the next few years. The Best of Gary North Tags: Gary North [ ] is the author of Mises on Money .

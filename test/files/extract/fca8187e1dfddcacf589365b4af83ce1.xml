An Oscar for Dreamgirls , an Emmy for Hairspray ?! 
We&apos;ve known for a couple months that NBC &apos;s next planned musical is none other than Hairspray Live! , but we only just got our first casting news for the event on Monday… and we could not be more excited! 
That&apos;s because it was just announced that Jennifer Hudson has been selected to play &quot;Motormouth&quot; Maybelle — the role Queen Latifah portrayed in the 2007 film! 
But that&apos;s not the only update we&apos;ve got for ya — Harvey Fierstein will also be reprising his role as Edna Turnblad, for which he won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical back in 2003! 
Two leads down, nine to go. 
Make sure to catch J.Hud, Harvey, and the rest of the to-be-determined cast when Hairspray Live! debuts Wednesday, December 7 on NBC! 
Whom do U want to see join the cast next??

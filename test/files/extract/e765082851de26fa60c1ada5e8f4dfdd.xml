In episode 40 of the EdTech TV Podcast I cover some of the highlights of the CUE conference that took place in March in Palm Springs, CA. I take a specific look at the vendors, the sessions, and the people of CUE. CUE in Review: a look back at #CUE16 – The Computer Using Educators’ Conference 
The annual CUE conference is the largest of its kind on the West Coast and brings together some of the brightest minds and most forward thinking teachers who want to integrate technology into their classrooms. CUE is a massive conference that spreads across several hotels in addition to the Palm Springs Convention Center. In this episode I discussed the Vendors, the Sessions, and the People at #CUE16 Vendors: 
Not a lot of vendors stood out this year, but a couple that caught my attention were: The Joy Factory – Illustrate Document Camera Sessions: Keynotes – While I missed the Keynotes, CUE has wisely been adding them as well as featured sessions up to their YouTube Channel. Many of them are worth a Saturday morning watch over a cup of coffee. Check them out at: The sessions I attended and mentioned on the show are listed below: Krystal Kirch – 5 Questions Every Flipped Classroom Teacher Must Answer:

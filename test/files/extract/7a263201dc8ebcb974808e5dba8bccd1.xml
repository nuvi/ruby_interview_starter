ALBANY — New York state will soon require health insurers to cover depression screening for pregnant women and new mothers. 
The move follows a recommendation from a federal panel that insurers cover maternal depression screening without a co-pay or deductible. 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo says the change will ensure that more pregnant and postpartum women can get the treatment they need. 
The state’s Department of Financial Services wrote to insurers about the change in a letter dated Monday. The department says insurers should begin providing the coverage as soon as they can, but no later than within six months. 
American Psychiatric Association President Renee Binder praised the state’s action, saying women struggling with maternal depression deserve screening and care for what is an “all-too-common” health condition.

We are a family and I look forward to seeing you all on Tuesday morning.&quot;Tuesday&apos;s show will be the first time Ripa and Strahan are reunited on camera since last week&apos;s announcement that the former football star will leave in September to work full time on ABC&apos;s &quot;Good Morning America.&quot;He&apos;s worked a couple of days a week at &quot;GMA&quot; for the past two years, but he always has to leave midway through to head to the &quot;Live with Kelly and Michael&quot; studio on Manhattan&apos;s upper West Side. &quot;Live&quot; is in the ABC family, produced by parent Walt Disney Co., and it airs after &quot;GMA&quot; in most TV markets.The former football star, who played with the New York Giants, will be joining the show&apos;s regular cast of Robin Roberts, George Stephanopoulos, Lara Spencer, Amy Robach and Ginger Zee.Actress Ana Gasteyer was a last-minute replacement for Ripa when she failed to come to work last Wednesday, with Erin Andrews, the co-host of &quot;Dancing With the Stars,&quot; then stepping in. Actress Shay Mitchell of &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot; was scheduled to co-host Monday.Ripa&apos;s unexplained absence came amid published reports that she felt blindsided and angered by Strahan&apos;s departure to join &quot;Good Morning America.&quot; She has not commented publicly.In mentioning his planned departure on &quot;Live&quot; last Wednesday, Strahan noted he&apos;d be an on-air neighbor on &quot;GMA.&quot;&quot;I was reading some stuff and it sounded like I had died,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s not a eulogy, people.&quot;Strahan also made a point of thanking Ripa, who welcomed him to the show in 2012 when he replaced Regis Philbin and taught him much about TV.&quot;Kelly, I thank you, I love you and everyone else here at &apos;Live,&apos;&quot; Strahan said.His planned exit has revived rumors that ABC is considering expanding the two-hour &quot;Good Morning America,&quot; which is first in the ratings but is losing viewers. The competing &quot;Today&quot; show on NBC airs for four hours. Related Topics:

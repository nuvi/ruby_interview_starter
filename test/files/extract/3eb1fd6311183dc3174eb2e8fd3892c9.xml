CLEVELAND (AP) — Go ahead and scream, Beliebers.
The Cavaliers swept the Detroit Pistons and spared Justin Bieber fans any heartbreak.
Cleveland&apos;s four-game romp over Detroit prevented a concert by the pop superstar scheduled for Tuesday night at Quicken Loans Arena from being postponed and rescheduled for another date. Bieber&apos;s sold-out show was in jeopardy because Game 5 in the series was also set for Tuesday.
However, LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and their teammates dodged any conflict by dispatching the Pistons in Game 4 on Sunday night.
The Cavs are now waiting to see if they&apos;ll play Atlanta or Boston in the next round. That series is tied 2-2.
With some down time before resuming their playoff run, they&apos;d have time to check out the Biebs on their home floor.

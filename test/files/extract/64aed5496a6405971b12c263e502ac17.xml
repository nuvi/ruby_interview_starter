Video has emerged of a rousing fight a Denny&apos;s server had in the middle of the restaurant with two customers, after an argument broke out about their respective sons. 
The fight was recorded inside one of the diner chain&apos;s stores in North Carolina. 
The server, who is not named, is seen in the clip screaming at the man and woman who are filming: &apos;My son is not a bully ... get out! Get out of here now! Your son is ugly!&apos; 
The video, which first appeared on LiveLeak, goes for just 1.5 minutes, however has amassed 30,000 views since it was uploaded. 
It begins with the waitress being asked by the people filming: &apos;So we can&apos;t eat here because your son is a bully?&apos; 
The waitress replied: &apos;And you are calling him a fat a--? Who is the adult?&apos; 
The server then gets even madder and starts yelling when the customers reiterate: &apos;You son is a fat a--.&apos; 
She later responds: &apos;Well your child is ugly, and you are retarded.&apos; (Excerpt) Read more at dailymail.co.uk ... TOPICS: Local News ; Society KEYWORDS: Here&apos;s the deal. Free Republic exists for you, and because of you. Without the generosity of people like you, Free Republic would wither and die. Then where would you go to find a group of like-minded people, standing for the values and principles of conservatism, spreading the word about those who would tear down our way of life, and just plain having fun?

I think we need to ascertain whether, in fact, the customer’s son is an ugly fat ass. 4 posted on 04/25/2016 11:23:05 AM PDT by Opinionated Blowhard (&quot;When the people find they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic.&quot;)

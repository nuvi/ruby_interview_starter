Dennie and Chris win Lyn Wild pairs The men’s interclub league did not go so well for Wanderers’ teams. 8 hours ago 
By Bob Hayward 
ON Wednesday, 20 April, Lyn Wild’s pairs were played at Wanderers Bowling Club. 
Clive Symons and Bob Hayward won the second session with 2 + 9; Dennis Gericke and Chris Klopper – who recently turned 88 – won the overall with the very good score of 4 + 33. 
‘Honey’ Kitchenbrand (R40) and Andy Cloete (R20) shared the 60/40 board spoils and Andy also won the meat raffle. Dirk Roos was delighted to win a magnetised screwdriver set donated by EIS, and Bob Hayward won a cap, glass and chips. The lotto of 1-2-10 was not won and will be yet another carry over. 
Steve Van Rooyen’s team had a good win in the midweek league when they beat a Hillary team at Durban. With only one more match to go in the sectional round robin, if they win it, they will proceed to the playoffs. They won it last year and are intent on a repeat performance. 
The men’s interclub league did not go so well for Wanderers’ teams. The A team lost 0-7 against the top dogs of Westville Bowling Club; the B side managed 2-5 against Toti away, thanks to a win by Robin Grobler’s side; the C side garnered the bonus point against Westville Country Club, thanks to Chris Klopper and his team, and the D side peeled one of their matches to get one point against Hillcrest at home, thanks to Titch Phillips’s side. 
Only one match was played in the men’s open singles. Bob Hayward beat Terry Brown 21-16, and will play Graham Funnell next Tuesday morning. 
Friday night’s snowball was not won as G Reddy was not present. Neither was the lotto won as nobody had the winning combination of 1-4-8. 
The various meat pack winners were: Rob Philogene (lamb pack), Jeff Cronje (rolled beef), Richard Hendicott (pork roast), Honey Kitchenbrand (rump steak and chicken), Ian Demmer (chicken pack). SHARE

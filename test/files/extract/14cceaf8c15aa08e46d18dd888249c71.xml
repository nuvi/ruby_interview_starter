Kim Kardashian West ‘froze’ on stage with Prince   
LONDON, Apr 25: Reality TV star Kim Kardashian West has recalled the moment she met Prince and “froze”. The 34-year-old reality TV star has posted a photograph on Instagram of her standing on stage with the ‘Purple Rain’ hitmaker – who died on Thursday at his Paisley Park home – back in 2011 and revealed she was left speechless, reported Femalefirst. She captioned the picture – which received 857 thousand likes, “I will always remember this moment with one of my favourite artists! I was so star struck I froze RIP Prince.” The pair met when the music icon invited the brunette beauty to join him on stage at Madison Square Garden in 2011. But when he shimmied up to her and indicated she should dance with him, she simply giggled and shook her head “no” and awkwardly clapped instead. Her reaction did not impress the “Little Red Corvette” singer, who promptly shooed her away and demanded she “get off the stage”. (PTI) Share this:

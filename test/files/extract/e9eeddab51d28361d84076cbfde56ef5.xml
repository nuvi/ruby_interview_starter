Tampa-based pet flight charity now focus of criminal investigation Tampa Bay Times , WTSP 11:00 AM. EST April 25, 2016 A December post on Twitter by Albert Lonzo Adams III directs donors to soaringpaws.com. (Twitter) CONNECT TWEET PINTEREST 
A month after a state agent knocked on the door of the rescue pilot behind Soaring Paws charity , the charity is now the subject of a criminal investigation. 
The subpoena sought animal flight logs, payroll ledgers and two years of detailed financial reports. It asked for names and contacts for board members and backers, including an alleged benefactor Adams calls the &quot;Amazon Rescue Foundation.&quot; 
Now, newly released financial records from the civil inquiry tell of pilot Albert Adams taking in more money than he previously reported to authorities. 
Our news partner The Tampa Bay Times found evidence that Soaring Paws makes undocumented claims to raise money on Facebook, including promises of sponsors matching funds. 
There were inconsistencies in Adams&apos; revenue reporting. Such inconsistencies have resurfaced as the state examines his books. 
At this time, Adams has not been charged.

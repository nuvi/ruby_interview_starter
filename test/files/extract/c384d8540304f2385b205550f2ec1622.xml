What Netflix looked like when it first started out — and how it&apos;s changed over the years From DVDs to streaming to becoming a global TV network — leaving established competitors like Blockbuster in the dust, see how Netflix has evolved over the years. Comment SJ News Online - St. John, KS By Nathan McAlone Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 11:00 AM By Nathan McAlone Business Insider Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 11:00 AM Netflix has gone through a whirlwind of changes since it began in 1997 as a DVD-by-mail service. The company has navigated the change from DVDs to streaming to becoming a global TV network — leaving established competitors like Blockbuster in the dust. But it hasn&apos;t been without hiccups along the way (remember the company&apos;s disastrous attempt to split into Netflix and Qwikster?) Jacinthe Busson, who runs the site UX Timelines , has compiled a timeline of Netflix&apos;s website changes from 1999 to present. Here&apos;s how its look has evolved: In 1999, Netflix hadn&apos;t even settled into its red color scheme yet. And there was an emphasis on Net and Flix as two separate entities. The name was stylized NetFlix, and there were things like FlixFinder (what they called their search feature). Netflix By 2004, Netflix began to settle into its signature look, but it was still firmly in the pre-streaming era. One of its big draws: no late fees — &quot;EVER!&quot; Netflix In 2008, Netflix introduced streaming (&quot;It&apos;s easier than you think!&quot;). But streaming still didn&apos;t have many new releases. Netflix By 2009, Netflix had introduced the &quot;happy family&quot; image that would continue to dominate its homepage. At this point, streaming worked on TVs with devices like Roku and Xbox 360. Netflix In 2010, streaming begins to be more than an add-on, and gets prominent real estate on the homepage. Netflix In 2011, you can see that streaming has become the main event. Also check out the Facebook integration, which subscribers did not respond favorably to. Netflix By 2012, most people understood the concept of Netflix, and the graphic walkthrough of the service was dropped from the homepage. And where are the DVDs? Netflix There wasn&apos;t much change from 2012 to 2013, but the style of the webpage became sleeker. Netflix There&apos;s also an emphasis on current big titles (and new Netflix originals). Netflix In 2014, not much changed, but the family appears a tad less like a stock image. Netflix By 2015, there&apos;s a nifty pop-down array that lets you see things like the big hits. Netflix In 2016, Netflix&apos;s homepage features a variety of different potential Netflix users (the images cycle through), and the company has stopped emphasizing the price point so prominently.

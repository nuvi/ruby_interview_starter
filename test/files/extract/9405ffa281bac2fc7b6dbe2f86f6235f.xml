Around a year ago we were jumping with joy after learning Anna Kendrick was going to write a book . 
Well now we not only have some deets on the book titled Scrappy Little Nobody , but we have our first look at the new cover!

The Pitch Pefect star took to Twitter to share: 
I have a book!! Why would anyone let me do this!? Go to https://t.co/MGBxhY9GIF to pre-order! #ScrappyLittleNobody pic.twitter.com/O6HlEUUm6c — Anna Kendrick (@AnnaKendrick47) April 25, 2016 
While this looks like a traditional book cover, there&apos;s a chance that Anna&apos;s just having some fun as the image does say &quot;Cover to be Unveiled&quot;. 
If this is indeed the finished cover, it&apos;s SO Anna! 
The actress&apos; book is actually already available for preorder and the 30-year-old cutie wrote a note with the book saying: 
&quot;I&apos;m excited to publish my first book, and because I get uncomfortable when people have high expectations, I&apos;d like to use this opportunity to showcase my ineptitude, pettiness, and the frequency with which I embarrass myself. And while many of my female inspirations who have become authors are incredibly well-educated and accomplished comedy writers, I&apos;m very, very funny on Twitter, according to Buzzfeed and my mom, so I feel like this is a great idea.&quot; 
Scrappy Little Nobody is set to be released November 15, 2016 and if you know you already need it in your life, you can preorder a copy HERE !

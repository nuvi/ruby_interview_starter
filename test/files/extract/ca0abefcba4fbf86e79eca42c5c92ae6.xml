 29 AM EDT Dr. Reich attends annual anxiety meeting 
Dr. Reich is proud to announce: 

He attended the annual meeting of the anxiety disorders association of america where he took a course on advanced cognitive behavioral therapy. 

Dr. Reich has held academic positions at Yale, the University of Iowa, Harvard and Brown. Currently he is Clinical Professor at UCSF and Consulting Professor at Stanford. He helps supervise a teaching group of drug treatment of psychiatric disorders for advanced trainees at UCSF. He has presented at the American Psychiatric Association annual meeting every year for over 30 years and many international conferences. 

Dr. Reich has been on the boards of the Association for Research in Personality Disorders (ARPD) and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders (ISSPD) for over twenty years. He is on the editorial board of Annals of Clinical Psychiatry and has been a reviewer at various times for twenty five academic journals including the American Journal of Psychiatry and Archives of General Psychiatry. 

He founded the Association for Research in Personality Disorders in 1983 and was given the ARPD Founder&apos;s Award in May 2007. (www.arpdonline.com) Other honors include being a Distinguished fellow of the American Psychiatry Association (1996) and a Lifetime Distinguished Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association (2015). Dr. Reich was rated as the fourteenth top psychiatrist in the nation by the US News and World Report in 2012 (an assessment by his psychiatric peers.) Dr. Reich was inducted into the American College of Psychiatrists in 2012, an exclusive organization limited to about 750 members worldwide. Dr. Reich is also an expert reviewer for the Medical board of California. 

Dr. Reich has over 100 publications of research articles, books and book chapters. He has published extensively in the mood disorders (anxiety and depression) and the personality disorders. His published areas include the effect of anxiety and depression on personality functioning, personality and the response of anxiety and depressive disorders to treatment, and the family history of anxiety and personality disorders. Dr. Reich also has several publications in the area of physician malpractice. 


Dr. Reich&apos;s teaching and academic work is pro bono and he earns his living in private practice of psychiatry. He has a small, discrete one person practice treating outpatients in his home town of San Francisco. Dr. Reich does both psychotherapy and medication management (his practice is a good place for someone looking for both from one provider doing both). His psychotherapy style is largely based on CBT but I also may use mindfulness or motivational interviewing techniques. (www.jamesreich.yourmd.com.) 

Dr. Reich has also at times done medical legal evaluations in the areas of worker&apos;s compensation, psychiatric malpractice and impaired nurses or physicians.

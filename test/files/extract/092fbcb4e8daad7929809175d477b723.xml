Officials have confirmed the death of a former New England Patriots player at only 29-years-old. 
The New England Patriots released a statement on the death of Ron Brace. 
The Boston Globe reports that Brace was the second-round pick of the Patriots in 2009 after a standout college career as defensive tackle at Boston College. 
His former football coach there, Al Washington, responded to the news on Twitter.

“It is difficult to believe that someone so young and in the prime of his life is no longer with us,” it read while offering condolences to the family. 
The team also pointed out that April 25 would be 7 years to the day he was drafted. 
So far, no organizations are releasing the cause of death.

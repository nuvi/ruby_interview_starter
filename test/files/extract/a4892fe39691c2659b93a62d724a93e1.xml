Retailer BHS facing collapse
U.K. shares swung lower Monday, with mining shares struggling at the start of the new trading week.
The FTSE 100 fell 0.3% to 6,292.09. All sectors fell, led by the basic materials and consumer goods groups. The blue-chips index on Friday dropped 1.1%, (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/uk-stocks-erase-weekly-gain-as-miners-slump-2016-04-22) ending last week lower by 0.5%.
The British benchmark on Monday is seeing &quot;mining stocks dominating the lower reaches of the index with a bit of skepticism in play here over just how much more headroom is left in terms of a rally for underlying prices,&quot; said Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct in a note. &quot;There&apos;s little restraint being shown in terms of reining in production and China&apos;s ability to keep consuming does have limits.&quot;
At the bottom of benchmark, iron ore heavyweight BHP Billiton PLC (BLT.LN) (BHP.AU) (BHP.AU) fell 4.1%, platinum provider Anglo American PLC (AAL.LN) dropped 3.9% and Rio Tinto PLC (RIO) (RIO) (RIO) lost 3.2%.
On the midcap FTSE 250 , Sports Direct International PLC (SPD.LN) shares were up 0.8% following reports the retailer had discussed a possible buyout of department store operator BHS. BHS was set to go into administration on Monday, putting roughly 11,000 jobs at risk.
The pound was up 0.1% at $1.4417. The pound gained ground Friday after U.S. President Obama urged Britons (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obama-expected-to-advise-uks-cameron-against-brexit-2016-04-22) to stick with the European Union when they vote on the issue on June 23. Obama told the BBC on Sunday that an exclusive trade deal between Britain and the U.S. could take up to 10 years (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obama-says-post-brexit-us-uk-trade-deal-could-take-a-decade-2016-04-24) to negotiate if the U.K. were to leave the EU.

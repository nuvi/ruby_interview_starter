A partner of troubled Malaysian government investment fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd. said Monday it would pay $50 million in overdue interest owed on a 1MDB bond, but only after the bond is declared in default.
The default could trigger further defaults on billions more in debt.
The partner, Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund International Petroleum Investment Corp., is a guarantor of the $1.75 billion bond privately issued by 1MDB in 2012, and will pay the interest under those obligations, IPIC said in a filing to the London Stock Exchange.
But IPIC said it would only do so if 1MDB itself defaulted on the payment. That could lead to cross defaults and demands for early repayment on at least 8.2 billion Malaysian ringgit ($2.1 billion) in other 1MDB debt, as well as on a $3 billion bond also privately issued by 1MDB in early 2013, according to a memo from 1MDB to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak viewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Both sides are preparing to enter arbitration over the disagreement, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The $50 million interest payment was due April 18 and Monday marks the end of a grace period for it to be paid. If the payment isn&apos;t made, 1MDB would be in default.
In its statement, IPIC said it understood 1MDB hadn&apos;t yet made the payment. IPIC also said it hadn&apos;t yet been asked to fulfill its role as guarantor.
&quot;If a 1MDB default occurs and IPIC is called upon in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the guarantee, IPIC will honor its obligations in relation to this interest payment, which shall be met out of IPIC&apos;s existing liquidity,&quot; IPIC said in the statement.
1MDB and Mr. Najib&apos;s office didn&apos;t answer requests for comment.
Earlier Monday, before IPIC&apos;s announcement, 1MDB&apos;s Chief Executive Arul Kanda told The Wall Street Journal &quot;we are not currently in a position to add any more than what has already been said.&quot;
The brinkmanship between 1MDB and IPIC over the $50 million interest payment reflects the rising stakes of a continuing scandal at 1MDB, which is under investigation in seven countries, including Malaysia.
Global investigators say they are looking into possible misappropriations of about $6 billion, said a person familiar with one country&apos;s probe. The 1MDB fund denies wrongdoing.
Defaults by 1MDB could also affect Malaysia&apos;s sovereign debt and currency, if the government is forced to bail out the fund.
&quot;If there is a need for early repayment of the debt and 1MDB is unable to do so, then there is a risk on [the] government of Malaysia,&quot; 1MDB said in the memo to Mr. Najib.
1MDB also told Mr. Najib it expects a significant strain from the situation, estimating it will have to pay lawyers, financial advisers and public relations firms around $1.8 million a month to help it navigate the potential defaults and limit their impact.
Investors so far appear confident in a resolution. The 1MDB bond in question isn&apos;t known to trade. However, prices for other 1MDB U.S. dollar bonds traded up slightly immediately after IPIC&apos;s statement.
1MDB&apos;s $1.75 billion in notes maturing in 2022 -- which are also guaranteed by IPIC -- were bidding at a yield of 5.99% after the statement versus 6.29% Monday morning, while the $3 billion in notes maturing in 2023 bidded at a yield of around 6.21% versus 6.40% this morning, according to a bond trader. Yields fall as bond prices rise.
Prices for Malaysian government bonds were mostly unchanged with yields of 3.423% and 3.805% for five-year and 10-year debt, respectively.
The dispute between 1MDB and IPIC erupted between the former allies this month, when IPIC accused 1MDB of reneging on key provisions of an agreement last year that saw IPIC extend a billion-dollar loan to 1MDB and assume responsibility for interest payments on some of its debt.
As a result, IPIC said it wouldn&apos;t make a regular interest payment that was due on April 18, raising the question of whether 1MDB would default on the bond when a grace period elapsed Monday.
Moody&apos;s Investors Service analyst Christian de Guzman said little had changed for 1MDB with Monday&apos;s statement from IPIC, which he said appeared designed to soothe concerns from IPIC&apos;s own investors that it would spurn its legal obligations.
IPIC is &quot;allaying market fears,&quot; Mr. de Guzman said. &quot;They are saying, we are willing to do what we need to do to preserve our credit.&quot;

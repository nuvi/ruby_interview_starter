  11:00 Sam Bradford Reportedly Requests Trade from Philadelphia Eagles The deal suggests Philadelphia will choose one of the two top QB prospects in Jared Goff and Carson Wentz. That also creates a situation where Bradford is a lame-duck starter of sorts—a stopgap option until the Eagles signal-caller of the future is... Elsa/Getty Images 68 Reads 0 Comments After the Philadelphia Eagles essentially dismissed him as their long-term answer at quarterback, Sam Bradford has reportedly requested a trade. 
ESPN&apos;s Adam Schefter reported the news Monday, adding Bradford won&apos;t be attending any additional sessions in the team&apos;s offseason program. 
Bradford&apos;s desire to get out of Philadelphia comes as little surprise after the Eagles traded with the Cleveland Browns last week to obtain the No. 2 overall pick in the 2016 NFL draft. 
The deal suggests Philadelphia will choose one of the two top QB prospects in Jared Goff and Carson Wentz. That also creates a situation where Bradford is a lame-duck starter of sorts—a stopgap option until the Eagles signal-caller of the future is ready to step in. 
Moving up to draft a QB so high is a bit of a surprise on Philadelphia&apos;s part, considering it reaffirmed its commitment to Bradford with a lucrative two-year, $35 million contract this offseason, per Spotrac. 
PhillyVoice&apos;s Jimmy Kempski expressed some skepticism regarding who would agree to land Bradford at that price: Bradford camp didn&apos;t get much interest around NFL prior to FA so he signed a 2 (more like 1) yr deal. Who does he think is trading for him? — Jimmy Kempski (@JimmyKempski) April 25, 2016 
Further complicating matters is how the team reportedly still would like Bradford to be its starter this coming season. According to NFL Network&apos;s Ian Rapoport, Philadelphia wants Bradford as its No. 1 QB in 2016 and was &quot;blindsided&quot; by his trade request. 
Although he showed some rust after not playing a down in 2014, Bradford played well toward the end of last season, registering a passer rating of 91.4 or better in six of his final seven starts. 
CSNPhilly.com&apos;s Reuben Frank was among those who had no sympathy for Bradford: Bradford has made over $100 million. ZERO winning seasons. ZERO playoffs. And now his feelings are hurt because he&apos;s being asked to compete? — Reuben Frank (@RoobCSN) April 25, 2016 
The 28-year-old is a former No. 1 overall pick who&apos;s evidently not intent to settle on the massive amounts of money he&apos;s made to date, though. Bradford seemingly wants to prove he was worth that billing. 
If he remains with the Eagles, he likely won&apos;t have more than a season or two to do so unless he plays at a truly elite level. 
Bradford&apos;s injury history is concerning, particularly his twice-torn left ACL, but since he held up for 14 games in 2015 and showed promise toward the end of the year, there should be a decent trade market for him. 
In addition to avoiding a potential locker room rift with its prospective new QB by dealing Bradford away, Philadelphia could regain a decent draft asset as compensation. Such a move would at least somewhat make up for the trove of picks it dealt to Cleveland, a haul that included a 2017 first-rounder and a 2018 second-round choice.

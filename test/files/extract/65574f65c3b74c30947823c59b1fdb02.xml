Palazzo hosts signature dish lunch Posted April 25, 2016 by Heather Hook 
Three top chefs at the ultra-luxurious Palazzo hotel at Montecasino presented a three-course masterpiece meal on 22 April at a Signature Dish lunch, with wine pairing by Tsogo Sun’s Group Sommelier, Miguel Chan. 
The starter was created by Gareth Jordaan, Executive Sous Chef, and featured variations of calamari, tomato confit, compressed cucumber, Pernod aïoli, lemon, and pickled onion. Perfectly matching the fresh, light flavours of the starter was a Paul Cluver Estate Gewurtztraminer. 
Executive Chef, Gerard Vingerling, was the mastermind behind the main course – a duck and cherry pie with crisp pancetta, liver pâté, roasted root vegetables, and duck and cherry jus. The rich, earthy flavours of the duck, liver and cherries was matched with Dutoitskloof Dimension Nebbiolo. 
The piéce de resistance was presented by Beverly Bogatsu, Pastry Chef, who gave the final touch to the signature menu with a dessert of strawberry marshmallows, with strawberry leather, ricotta fritters, and white chocolate sauce. Sommelier Miguel Chan’s selection of wine to accompany this unique and decadent creation was Graham Beck Brut Rose. 
The event gave guests the opportunity to experience the innovative talents of the hotel’s leading chefs in the spectacular location of the Medeo Restaurant, with its double-volume windows overlooking a magnificent koi pond, rolling lawns and distant Magliesberg mountains. At Medeo, Chef Gerard provides freshly prepared culinary excellence with a menu that encompasses the delicious flavours of the Mediterranean and a wine list of carefully selected international and South African wines, as well as Tsogo Sun’s rare auction wines. 
The restaurant is beautifully styled in line with the hotel’s Tuscan theme and offers a highly sophisticated and spacious setting that perfectly complements the excellence of the menus. 
Medeo serves meals throughout the day, with a buffet breakfast, a la carte menu and daily high tea. It also services the lovely terrace and pool deck, where guests can enjoy refreshments while taking in the picturesque scenery. 
“The Palazzo is arguably the most beautiful hotel in Joburg, and we aim to ensure that our culinary offering matches the beauty of the hotel’s architecture, design and setting,” concludes Robert Jasper, General Manager of The Palazzo at Montecasino.

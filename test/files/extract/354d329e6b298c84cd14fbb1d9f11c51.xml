Axalta Coating Systems Launches E-Commerce App for Powder Coatings Customers in Europe April 25, 2016 - 11:48 AM PDT COLOGNE, Germany 
( Business Wire ) Axalta Coating Systems, a leading global supplier of liquid and powder coatings, has introduced a new smartphone app designed to make ordering products quicker, easier and more efficient for its European powder coating customers. The app will work in conjunction with the powder webshop – Axalta Powdershop – which has been available in Europe since late 2015. 
“We looked at the status quo in our industry and realized there had to be a better way than lengthy, handwritten ordering which can cause delays through purchasing departments,” noted Thomas Kopp, Business Director of Axalta’s powder coatings business in Europe. “We used this insight to develop a simple self-service solution that is available 24/7, making the entire ordering process more convenient and efficient.” 
Once the app is downloaded onto a smart phone, customers can sign in and scan the product codes in the warehouse. They will immediately be taken to the full Axalta powder product catalogue, with a clear overview of pricing, real-time availability and delivery time. With a single click, customers can add the required quantity to their wish list or process the final order once complete. 
The app has been designed with Axalta’s customers in mind; it is compatible with many different logistics software packages so that it can easily be integrated into Axalta’s customers’ overall workflow. It is currently available for customers in Belgium and France and will soon be available in Sweden and Germany. Availability in other countries will follow in due course. To download the app, search Axalta Powdershop in Google Play. The Apple App Store version will follow later in 2016.

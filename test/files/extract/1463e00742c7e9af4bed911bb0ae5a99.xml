For six years, John Harris and John Domokos have travelled the UK to get a sense of British politics away from the Westminster bubble. Meanwhile, old-fashioned two-party politics has crumbled amid a rising sense of discontent with the status quo. For their new series, the pair are back on the road, hunting down radical new politics in some unlikely places

Interesting that this sort of question is being finally asked.
Government is too centralised around Westminster. There are too many career politicians. There are too many politicians (perhaps 200 should be the number), they should have some life experience (a proper job outside politics) and have a social and moral outlook to work from.
Certain elements of daily life need to be taken out of the party political system i.e. the NHS, education, energy, transportation, defence, business development, housing, etc. and cross party long term 20/30 years strategic development needs to happen. That would stop the pathetic \&quot;my prams bigger than your pram\&quot; political crap.
Britain is a very resourceful country so why do politicians work at exploiting that innate national ability?
Governments need to work with and pump prime new ideas and people with ideas in areas where businesses are stagnating. becoming obsolete and jobs are becoming scarce. Not all will be successful but some will be and that will crate jobs and employment.
Centralised government has failed the people of this country since the late 70&apos;s abysmally.

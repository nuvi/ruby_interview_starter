Turkish dailies on Monday cover Daesh rocket attacks hitting southern border province of Kilis Anadolu Agency does not verify these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.
Turkish dailies on Monday covered Daesh rocket attacks in Turkey’s southern Kilis province, which killed a man and wounded 26 others Sunday.
HURRIYET’s headline read “Daesh does not stop”, reporting that five Katyusha artillery rockets had been fired from Syria in Kilis’ city center.
MILLIYET wrote that a projectile landed just 100 meters away from the local Governor&apos;s Office building when Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Yalcin Akdogan was reportedly inside.
STAR ran the headline: “Katyusha rocket landed while [Akdogan] was in a meeting.”
The daily Quote: d the deputy premier as saying: “Since Jan. 18, 45 rocket projectiles have hit Kilis; 16 of our citizens have lost their lives and 62 of our citizens have been injured.”
Kilis lies six kilometers (four miles) from the Syrian border and has been repeatedly hit by rockets fired from Syria. Nine people have been killed in the province by rockets since last Monday.
Dailies SABAH, HABERTURK, YENISAFAK, VATAN, AKSAM and CUMHURIYET also ran similar front-page headlines.
In other news, the dailies also covered the Trabzonspor - Fenerbahce derby game abandoned after a fan attacked the assistant referee at Huseyin Avni Aker Stadium.
HURRIYET’s headline read: “Terror on the pitch.”
The daily wrote that a football hooligan entered the pitch from behind the goalkeeper’s post and attacked the assistant referee, Volkan Bayarslan, during the 89th minute while the Istanbul side Fenerbahce led 4-0 in the Trabzon game.
“Disgrace at 89” was HABERTURK’s front-page, reporting that Trabzonspor would face a stadium ban for seven or eight matches, plus its league points would also be erased.
The match fiasco also dominated other dailies’ headlines.
SABAH wrote &quot;an insane man came down from the tribune, slaughtered football,&quot; YENISAFAK’s headline was &quot;Troubled derby&quot;, while CUMHURIYET chose &quot;Match of shame&quot;.
VATAN said the assailant would be charged with attacking a commissioned officer and could face up to four years in prison.
In economics news, financial newspaper DUNYA reported that Erdogan joined the opening ceremony of a fossil fuel power plant established by Sabanci Holding with Germany’s E.ON in Adana, a major city in southern Turkey, Sunday.

Transcript: Should Trump Worry About Cruz and Kasich Working Together? 
Republican presidential hopefuls John Kasich and Ted Cruz are working together against Donald Trump –– a move Trump is calling &quot;weak and desperate.&quot; But is he right? 
Cruz and Kasich announced Sunday they&apos;d divide campaign resources for three states&apos; upcoming primaries. 
A statement released by Cruz&apos;s camp calls a Trump nomination &quot;a sure disaster for Republicans.&quot; It&apos;s completely possible Trump would win a majority of delegates. 
Even that doesn&apos;t guarantee him the nomination, which is kind of a long story. 
But it&apos;d be a lot easier for Trump opponents to just prevent him from getting that majority in the first place. 
And one state in particular has been called a must-win for Trump if he wants to avoid a contested convention: Indiana. You can see why Cruz and Kasich working together in that state is a smart move . Still, their partnership is a limited one. 
Just a day after both campaign announcements, Kasich said he isn&apos;t telling supporters not to vote for him in Indiana. &quot;I&apos;ve never told them not to vote for me,&quot; Kasich said. 
&quot;They ought to vote for me. 
But I&apos;m not over there campaigning and spending resources.&quot; Cruz and Kasich are still planning to openly compete against each other for hundreds of delegates . 
And even though they&apos;re partnering over Indiana, Oregon and New Mexico, their competition in California alone is worth nearly twice as many delegates. Kasich sits at a distant third in terms of delegates now, but Cruz and Trump can&apos;t be taking him lightly. 
In a recent poll about a hypothetical contested convention, Kasich had the most political insiders backing him. 
&quot;I think what Donald Trump needs to understand is that he cannot beat Hillary Clinton,&quot; he told reporters Monday. And he&apos;s the only Republican candidate who&apos;s beaten Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in several general election scenarios . Cruz, on the other hand, trails Clinton by a narrow margin in similar polls.

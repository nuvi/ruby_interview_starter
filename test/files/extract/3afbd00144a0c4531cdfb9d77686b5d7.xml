Brother and sister walk 113 miles non-stop to raise cash for hospice at home charity CHALLENGE: Ellie Bates with her mum, Wendy Bridgstock 0 comments 
A HOSPICE at home charity has received a cash boost from a brother and sister who took on a 113 mile walking challenge to give thanks for the care their mum receives. 
Ellie Bates and Neil Bridgstock have raised £4,000 for Herriot Hospice Homecare, based in Northallerton , which gives complementary therapy care to their mum Wendy, from Tunstall, near Catterick . 
Mrs Bates, 37, and Mr Bridgstock, 35, wanted to give something back to the charity which helps their mum, who has motor neurone disease.

They walked almost the entire length of the Liverpool to Leeds Canal – 113 miles – in 41 hours without a rest, but were disappointed to have to stop 14 miles short of the full 127 mile distance after they said their bodies “gave up.” 
Mrs Bridgstock receives aromatherapy from Herriot Hospice Homecare, which provides care and support to people with life limiting illnesses in Richmondshire and Hambleton. 
Mrs Bates said: “Neil and I are very active and enjoy doing outdoor activities, so when we decided to raise money for Herriot, we came up with the idea of walking along the Liverpool to Leeds Canal. 
“We wanted to do it in one go without sleeping and with only very short breaks, but even though we are very fit, it was tough and our bodies literally gave up and we had to stop.” 
While they were walking, Mrs Bates’ husband John kayaked the length of the canal, and between them they managed to raise an additional £5,000 for the Motor Neurone Disease Association. 
Mrs Bridgstock was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2014 and her condition deteriorated quickly. She is now wheelchair-bound, unable to speak or feed herself, but has refused to let the disease get the better of her. 
Mrs Bates said: “Like myself, Neil and our dad Pete, mum was very active before she was diagnosed and she has kept her positivity and strength throughout. 
“My dad is mum’s main carer but the support they have received from Herriot has been fantastic.” 
Leanne Hardcastle, Herriot Hospice Homecare events fundraiser, said: “£4,000 is a massive amount of money for Herriot Hospice Homecare and it will enable us to do so much good in the communities we serve. 
“It’s so inspiring when you see people like Ellie and Neil and we would like to thank them for their wonderful support.” Share:

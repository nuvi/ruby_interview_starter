Find us on Twitter Cosby&apos;s criminal case can resume after court rejects appeal Associated Press   2:27 PM PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A Pennsylvania appeals court has rejected Bill Cosby&apos;s attempt to halt his criminal case because of what he called a decade-old deal not to prosecute him. The mid-level state Superior Court ruled Monday that the criminal sex-assault case against Cosby can proceed. The 78-year-old Cosby is facing trial over a 2004 encounter at his home with a then-Temple University employee. The woman says she was drugged and molested. Cosby says they engaged in consensual sex acts. Former prosecutor Bruce Castor has said he promised he would never prosecute Cosby and urged him to testify in the woman&apos;s civil lawsuit. The release of that testimony last year led a new prosecutor to arrest him. The long-married Cosby acknowledged a series of affairs and said he got quaaludes to give to women he hoped to seduce.

Things have just gotten worse for Heisman Trophy Winner, Johnny Manziel, the former NFL quarterback has been indicted on assault charges. According to the Dallas County District Attorney, a grand jury indicted Manziel on a misdemeanor assault with bodily injury charge. The embattled football star is accused of striking his ex-girlfriend, Colleen Crowley, after a night out on the town in January. 
The incident occurred while Manziel drove Crowley from a Dallas area hotspot to her home in Fort Worth. According the court documents, Crowley begged the valet at Hotel Zara to protect her from Manziel’s violent outburst saying, “Please don’t let him take me,&quot; and “I’m scared for my life.” According to the police reports, Crowley attempted to jump from a moving car to escape Manziel but the former Aggie dragged the model back into the car and continued hitting her. 
The Dallas police department opted not to arrest Manziel and to send the case to the grand jury to decide if they should charge the 23-year old with misdemeanor assault. This is not Manziel’s first run in with the law, the former Browns player was arrested in June of 2015 for driving under the influence. In March, the Cleveland Browns released Manziel citing his poor game performances and erratic off-the-field behaviors. 
A judge granted a protective order against Manziel after the altercation that requires him to stay 500ft away from Crowley’s home until at least February of 2018. Additionally, Manziel must pay Crowley’s attorney fees in the amount of $12,500 and cannot possess a firearm until the protective order expires. Insiders claim Manziel and Crowley reached an out-of-court civil settlement in relation to the incident although no details have been released about the amount agreed upon. 
Neither Manziel or Crowley have commented on the case since formal charges were filed.

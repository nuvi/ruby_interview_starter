AIKEN, SC --(Marketwired - April 25, 2016) - Security Federal Corporation (&quot;Company&quot;) (OTCBB: SFDL), the holding company for Security Federal Bank (&quot;Bank&quot;), today announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Net income available to common shareholders increased $213,000 or 15.3% to $1.6 million or $0.55 per common share (basic) for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, compared to $1.4 million or $0.47 per common share (basic) for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. The increase in earnings was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income combined with a decrease in non-interest expense, offset by a decrease in non-interest income. 
The Company&apos;s net interest spread increased 19 basis points to 3.28% for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, compared to 3.09% for the same quarter in 2015. The improvement in net interest spread was achieved through lower cost of funds as total interest expense decreased $254,000 or 21.7% to $919,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 compared to $1.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Consistent with the increase in interest spread, net interest income increased $290,000 or 5.0% to $6.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, compared to $5.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. 
There was no provision for loan losses recorded by the Company during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 compared to $100,000 for the same period in 2015. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was the result of a decrease in net charge-offs and non-performing assets. The Company had net charge-offs of $2,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $536,000 or 99.6% from $538,000 in net charge-offs for the comparable period in 2015. Non-performing assets decreased $1.1 million or 9.9% to $10.3 million at March 31, 2016 from $11.4 million at December 31, 2015. At March 31, 2016, non-performing assets to total assets was 1.27%, a decrease of 15 basis points from 1.42% at December 31, 2015. 
Non-interest income decreased $823,000 or 31.0% to $1.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 from $2.7 million for the same quarter in 2015. The decrease is primarily the result of a $1.2 million decrease in net gain on sale of investments partially offset by a $265,000 increase in grant income. 
Non-interest expense decreased $719,000 or 11.5% to $5.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 compared to $6.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $755,000 net gain on the sale of other real estate owned (&quot;OREO&quot;), which was recorded as an offset to the cost of operating OREO properties during the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The majority of the net gain on OREO sales was related to the sale of one OREO property in February 2016, which resulted in a $739,000 gain. Prepayment penalties on Federal Home Loan Bank (&quot;FHLB&quot;) advances decreased to $248,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 compared to $788,000 for the same quarter in 2015. The Bank prepaid $5.0 million in FHLB advances during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 compared to $15.0 million during the first quarter of 2015 in order to reduce interest expense in future periods and improve net interest spread. 
Total assets increased $11.3 million or 1.4% to $811.0 million at March 31, 2016 from $799.7 million at December 31, 2015. Net loans receivable increased $1.3 million or 0.4% to $331.9 million at March 31, 2016 from $330.6 million at December 31, 2015. Investment and mortgage-backed securities increased $13.2 million or 3.3% to $418.6 million at March 31, 2016 from $405.4 million at December 31, 2015. Total deposits increased $9.1 million or 1.4% to $661.2 million at March 31, 2016 compared to $652.1 million at December 31, 2015. FHLB advances, other borrowings, convertible senior debentures and subordinated debentures decreased $1.5 million or 2.8% to $50.8 million at March 31, 2016 from $52.3 million at December 31, 2015. 
Security Federal Bank has 14 full service branch locations in Aiken, Ballentine, Clearwater, Columbia, Graniteville, Langley, Lexington, North Augusta, Wagener and West Columbia, South Carolina and Evans, Georgia. A full range of financial services, including trust and investments, are provided by the Bank and insurance services are provided by the Bank&apos;s wholly owned subsidiary, Security Federal Insurance, Inc. 
The Bank held a groundbreaking ceremony on March 31, 2016 for its newest branch in Evans, Georgia. The new location, scheduled for opening in late 2016, will be a full-service branch offering depository banking as well as commercial, personal and mortgage lending.

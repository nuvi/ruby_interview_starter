The developer of a former “racino” site in Reading has objected to a Tree Protection Order on a strip of woodland, Get Reading has reported. 
Reading planners will be asked to stand up for a “woodland strip” in Whitley. 
The trees between Island Road and the River Kennet are currently subject to a tree preservation order (TPO) notice. 
Reading Borough Council has received an objection to the TPO from Turley Associates on behalf of the landowner TransEuropean V (Reading) Limited and the developer Evander Properties. 
Evander has planning consent for more than 24,000sqm of industrial buildings with “no specific definition” in the former “racino” site. 
The council owns land directly to the west and served a TPO on the belt of trees in February this year. 
The objection refers only to the tree within the development site. 
It says: “It is believed that the TPO was made as a result of the recent planning permission. “The TPO is considered unnecessary as the approved planning documentation clearly shows that the development will not have an adverse impact on the trees, with the approved aboricultural method statement providing necessary protection for the trees through the development process. 
“No assessment of the amenity value has been provided for this tree group in support of the TPO.” 
Council officers say in a report to the Reading Borough Council planning committee on Wednesday, April 27: “The trees are important to the character of the area, providing an important buffer to the River Kennet and are prominent locally.” 
Councillors will consider the TPO and the objection at the meeting next week.

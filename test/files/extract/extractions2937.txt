This is the heart-rending moment that one man dared to rescue a poor, helpless minion that had become stuck on the motorway as cars careered past at high speeds. 
Or something like that. 
In reality, this was the scene earlier this afternoon after a fairground trailer overturned between Junction 8 and Junction 9 of the M27 earlier this afternoon. 
Fire crews from Eastleigh and Fareham in Hampshire were called shortly after 1pm today to the incident – but confirmed that no injuries had occurred. Drivers faced long delays on the M27 after a fairground trailer crashed on the motorway (Picture: UKNIP) 
Photos show the fairground trailer, which has the words ‘hot shots’ written across it in lights, lying on its side after it flipped and jack-knifed on the M27. 
All three lanes of the motorway were closed – and traffic was running on the hard shoulder while crash recovery works took place. No one is believed to have been seriously hurt (Picture: UKNIP) 
Severe delays were reported in the aftermath of the incident, but have since been dealt with. More

New Home Sales (March 2016) 
– New Home Sales seasonally adjusted, annualized 511,000. Previous was 519,000. This is weak. We should probably be happy with a level of about 700,000-800,000. 
Dallas Federal Reserve Manufacturing Survey (April 2016) 
– Production Index 5.8. Previous was 3.3– General Activity Index -13.9. Previous was -13.6. 
This is a survey index of manufacturing in the state of Texas. The General Activity Index has been negative for 16 consecutive months. This is almost entirely about oil prices.

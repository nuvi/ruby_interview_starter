Iconic female rapper Lil’ Kim has undergone dramatic physical changes since debuting her first single, “Crush On You” in 1996. In fact, many original fans of the rapper may find it hard to recognize her now that her facial features appear altered and her skin tone appears much lighter. 
On Sunday (April 24 th ) the Queen B posted a photo on Instagram sparking outrage on social media. The collage depicts six images of Kim posing with pink lip and a blonde wig, she captioned the photo, “Miami Heat!!!”. Twitter exploded within minutes with many fans questioning the validity of the picture, one fan said, “Wow is that really Lil’ Kim looking like a One Direction member?” 
The Brooklyn native has faced tons of criticism over her ever-changing appearance for years with many fans concerned about the star’s alleged obsession with altering her face. Kim once spoke about her battle with low self-esteem saying, “Guys always cheated on me with women who were European-looking. You know, the long-hair type. Really beautiful women that left me thinking, &apos;How I can I compete with that?”. 
The legendary emcee rarely acknowledges her transformation and often claps back at media outlets that publicize her rumored cosmetic procedures.

President Obama is on his way back to Washington after a week away from the White House to visit Saudi Arabia, England and Germany. 
Here are 10 photo highlights from his trip. When he looked at his hand through virtual reality glasses at a German industrial fair: German Chancellor Angela Merkel looks confused as Obama tests virtual reality glasses. (Image credit: Alexander Koerner/Getty Images) When he watched a giant robot arm at the same event—and he looked bored. (Image credit: TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP/Getty Images) REALLY, bored. 
When he rode shotgun at Windsor Castle in a Range Rover driven by Queen Elizabeth II’s husband, the Duke of Edinburgh. The Duke is 94-years-old. Secret Service didn’t see a problem with it. (Image credit: GEOFF PUGH/AFP/Getty Images) In the backseat, the Queen looked bored. When he was upstaged by the giant floral arrangements and a golden box of kleenex during a meeting with King Salman of Saudi Arabia. (Image credit: SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images) When he got frustrated, yelling “Robbed!”, after his ball barely missed the hole while playing golf in England with Prime Minister David Cameron. &quot;Did you see that? Robbed!&quot; President Obama plays a round of golf with David Cameron #ObamaInUK https://t.co/zMtGC3EAeu 
— Sky News (@SkyNews) April 24, 2016 When he posed with the Queen during lunch in England and everyone thought Michelle Obama’s dress was a tribute to Prince. It wasn’t. Her clothes are custom and pre-selected, and she was likely already en route to London when the musician’s death was announced. (Image credit: John Stillwell – WPA Pool/Getty Images) When he met with European leaders at a summit in Germany at a short table, with little chairs… (Image credit: Maja Hitij – Pool /Getty Images) …as opposed to meeting with Gulf Corporation Council leaders at a summit in Saudi Arabia at a huge table with giant chairs. (Image credit: JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images) When he went to dinner at the home of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge—aka Will and Kate—and Prince Harry was so casual he wore jeans. (Image credit: Dominic Lipinski – WPA Pool/Getty Images) When he watched Prince George ride the rocking horse that he and Michelle Obama gave him two years ago when he was born. The rocking horse’s saddle has the Presidential Seal on it, and was partially made from a piece of oak from a tree on the South Lawn of the White House. Prince George thanks @BarackObama for his rocking horse, given to him when he was born pic.twitter.com/xXIF8QeQvz 
— Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) April 22, 2016 And, finally, when the world cooed a collective “awwww,” as he shook hands with little George in his monogrammed bathrobe—he got to stay up late to meet the president. (Image credit: Pete Souza/The White House via Getty Images)

&apos;We expect no change in [Fed] policy, but the statement will probably be more hawkish,&apos; says analyst
The dollar weakened against its major rivals on Monday as investors squared positions ahead of policy meetings by the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan later this week.
The U.S. dollar weakened to as low Yen110.97, but recovered somewhat to trade at Yen111.26 late Monday in New York compared with Yen111.80 late Friday. The Japanese currency has strengthened significantly since the start of the year, creating a headache for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe because a weaker currency&apos;s pro-export benefits was previously seen as one of his administration&apos;s biggest accomplishments.
&quot;The BOJ easing did not cause yen to rally earlier this year, rather the yen rallied despite the central bank&apos;s actions, mostly because investors are unclear about the impact of negative rates. That suggests that further moves in the yen would be limited,&quot; said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange.

A two-day meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers will conclude Wednesday, while the Bank of Japan will announce any policy changes on Thursday.

The dollar weakened against the euro, changing hands at $1.1268 compared with $1.1233 late Friday in New York.
&quot;We expect no change in policy, but the statement will probably be more hawkish, and we will be paying attention to how the Fed characterizes international risks,&quot; Esiner said.
Esiner said that the market is underpricing the risk of a rate increase in June.&quot;The Fed may attempt to nudge the market toward expecting a rate hike in June by sounding more hawkish in its statement,&quot; he said.
In other pairs, the dollar weakened against the British pound, trading at $1.4483 compared with $1.4413 late Friday in New York.
The ICE dollar index , a measure of the dollar against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.3% at 94.79.

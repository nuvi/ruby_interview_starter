Pennsylvania, one of the most delegate-rich states left on the primary schedule, looks like it will be an easy pickup for frontrunners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll has The Donald up 18 points over rival Sen. Ted Cruz and 21 points over Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who grew up in the Keystone State.
Over on the Democratic side, Clinton is besting Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by 15 points.

Republican frontrunner Donald Trump (left) and Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton (right) both have comfortable leads in Pennsylvania, the delegate-rich prize that votes Tuesday
Donald Trump is way ahead of the Republican pack in polling out today from Pennsylvania, where voters head to the polls on Tuesday
In the NBC poll, the state&apos;s likely Republican voters give Trump 45 percent support, Cruz 27 percent support and Kasich 24 percent support.
Fifty-five percent of the state&apos;s likely Democratic voters support Clinton, while 40 percent like Sanders.
Trump has an even bigger lead in a new CBS News Battleground Tracker poll that came out this morning.
In that poll, Trump leads Cruz by 23 points, earning the support of 49 percent of likely Republican voters.
Cruz earns the support of 26 percent and Kasich is last again earning 22 percent support.
The numbers are tighter on the Democratic side in the CBS poll.
Clinton bests Sanders by eight points, receiving 51 percent of support from Pennsylvania&apos;s likely Democratic voters to Sanders 43 percent.
If Clinton&apos;s lead holds, because of the Democrats&apos; proportional distribution of delegates, a win in Pennsylvania Tuesday night will be another nail in the Sanders campaign&apos;s coffin, as the former secretary of state has a nearly insurmountable lead in the pledged delegates that she needs to win her party&apos;s nomination.
Democrat Hillary Clinton has a 15 point lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Keystone State, which hosts a closed Democratic primary, which puts Sanders at a disadvantage
 Next Bernie Sanders doesn&apos;t condemn Rosario Dawson for bringing... Could it be an all-woman ticket? Hillary campaign refuses to... Colorado Republican demands a sheriff for protection at GOP... &apos;Most young people aren&apos;t voting&apos; said Chelsea Clinton... 17 shares Additionally like New York, Pennsylvania holds a closed primary, which would bar a slew of independent voters coming to the polls to support Sanders.
If Trump wins the state he&apos;s only guaranteed 17 delegates of the 71 up for grabs.
That&apos;s because voters in Pennsylvania choose three delegates from each congressional district to head to the convention too, but who those delegates support isn&apos;t noted on the ballot.
Cruz has worked a successful ground game in other states ensuring that delegates – even those &apos;bound&apos; to Trump on the first ballot – are actually the Texas senator&apos;s supporters and he may pursue the same strategy in Pennsylvania to rout the New York billionaire.
On May 3, Cruz has another opportunity, in Indiana&apos;s primary, to grab delegates away, as he mathematically can&apos;t win enough delegates to clinch the GOP nomination outright and must work to prevent Trump from earning it on the first ballot.
Polling out of Indiana, however, still looks fairly good for Trump.
The CBS News Battleground Tracker has the businessman five points ahead.
Forty percent of likely Republican voters in the state prefer Trump, 35 prefer Cruz and 20 percent say they like Kasich.
On the Democratic side, the polls are closer too.
Clinton is ahead with 49 percent support, while Sanders earns 44 percent.

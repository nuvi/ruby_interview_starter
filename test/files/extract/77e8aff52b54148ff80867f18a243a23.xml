There&apos;s never been a better time to travel to Nepal, especially as the country needs you more than ever. Getty 
Kathmandu, Nepal, for once not packed with visitors. 
Milan Bajracharya was on a spiral staircase, high on the Swayambhunath hill overlooking Kathmandu, when the earthquake hit. “We were holding on, and I saw the metal of the staircase begin separating from the building,&quot; Bajracharya said. &quot;Then it stopped. I looked out over the city and there was only a thick haze of dust. I wondered if Kathmandu still existed beneath it.” 
The 7.8-magnitude earthquake of April 25, 2015 killed more than 8,800 people in Nepal, flattening homes and historic sites , and causing an avalanche on Mt. Everest that killed 21 and branded the date as the deadliest in the history of the mountain. 
As expected, tens of thousands of travelers and foreigners in the country headed for the country’s only international airport, fleeing aftershocks and a country rendered temporarily unable to display its world-renowned hospitality. The crowd at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan Airport was so immense, in fact, that the airport terminal was forced to throw open its doors and allow people to wait on the tarmac, right in front of aircraft. The visitors left then, and they’ve been slow to return . Bajracharya, general manager of tour operator TWX, is Nepalese and, for a moment, wondered if he was witnessing the collapse of his country&apos;s capital. When the haze cleared, the city was still there—but the real damage was yet to come. 
Tourism is Nepal’s largest industry and, according to Nepal’s Ministry of Tourism , 2014 saw more than 790,000 tourists and $471 million dollars spent. The hope was that 2015 would bring in over 900,000 visitors, but the Kathmandu Post reports that in 2015, due to the quake, only 500,000 made the trip. Jobs, families, and livelihoods are the overlooked aftermath in the damaged economy. Related Content What to Do When a Crisis Strikes During Travel 
In Nepal, everyone has their earthquake story, harrowing tales of luck and confusion or loss and sadness. Now, a year later, those stories finally end in smiles and optimism. The rebuilding has begun, with structures rising in line with earthquake-resistant standards and wired for solar energy. Only 11 of the country’s 75 districts and three of the 35 trekking routes felt the impact of the quake, while the big-draw sites such as Basantapur Durbar Square in Kathmandu and Everest Base Camp in the Solukhumbu region are very much open for business. I saw this myself last month, on the first tour by Friendly Planet in the country since the earthquake forced suspension of the tours . 
Still, the dearth of international tourists is noticeable; instead of meeting Europeans and fellow Americans on multi-week, once-in-a-lifetime trips along the trail to Everest Base Camp, I encountered Cambodian and Bangladeshi trekkers visiting for a long weekend. At the upscale Everest View Hotel—the highest luxury hotel in the world at 13,000 feet, equipped with its own helipad and a breathtaking view of the eponymous mountain—the lobby was cold and dark; no overnight visitors are in the guestbook and there was little activity beyond the few trekkers who stopped by the terrace cafe for tea and selfies. In Kathmandu, the drop-in visits to Bhaktapur Durbar Square, a pedestrian plaza ringed with exquisitely detailed palaces and temples, means locals have turned it into a temporary parking lot. The recent visit of Britain’s Prince Harry—who enjoyed his time in Nepal so much he extended his trip by six days and Instagrammed throughout —may have drawn much-needed attention to Nepal, but action is what will save the country. There has never been a better, more affordable, less crowded time to visit Nepal. Go now.

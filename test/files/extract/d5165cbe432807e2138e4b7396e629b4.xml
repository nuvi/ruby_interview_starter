Oil futures edge lower in choppy trade
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid more than 100 points on Monday, eroding some of its modest gains from last week, as investors weighed a round of lackluster earnings and awaited policy decisions by the Bank of Japan and Federal Reserve later in the week.
After fluctuating between small gains and losses earlier in the session, oil prices moved lower, with West Texas Intermediate crude futures dropping (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/oil-prices-pitch-lower-as-investors-cash-in-on-recent-gains-2016-04-25) 46 cents, or 1%, to $43.29 a barrel.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 102 points, or 0.6%, to 17,899, as Caterpillar Inc.(CAT)(UTX) and DuPont Co.(DD) led blue chips lower.
Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 lost 11 points, or 0.5%, to 2,080.
The Nasdaq Composite lost 22 points, or 0.4%, to 4,884.
Central bank policy is expected to remain a prominent theme this week. Signs of rising inflation in the U.S. might influence the Fed to adopt slightly more hawkish language in its monetary policy statement, which is expected to be released after the close of the meeting on Wednesday, analysts said.
&quot;People will be keen to see if there&apos;s a switch in tone from the recent more dovish comments,&quot; said Oliver Pursche, chief executive officer at Bruderman Brothers. &quot;I would not be surprised if you saw something like &apos;we&apos;re holding off because of stuff that&apos;s going on internationally but the U.S. economy is ready for a hike.&apos;&quot;
The Fed--which raised interest rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade--is widely expected to leave rates unchanged this week. A major question for investors right now is whether the Fed is on course to raise interest rates again this year and, if so, how many times in 2016 rates are likely to go up.

&quot;I still believe we&apos;ll see two rate hikes from the Fed this year and the FOMC statement will confirm its intentions to do so. What the markets are looking for though is an idea of when we can expect them, with the June and December meetings looking the most likely,&quot; said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.
There were no Fed speakers on tap for Monday as the central bank is in its &quot;blackout period&quot; ahead of this week&apos;s meeting.
The Bank of Japan announces its policy decision on Thursday and is expected to launch additional easing measures.

But a big upward revision to February&apos;s number was seen as evidence that the housing market&apos;s steady recovery continued.

Private-equity firm KKR &amp; Co.(KKR) posted a bigger-than-forecast loss for the first quarter.
Tribune Publishing Co. (TPUB) shares soared after Gannett Co. Inc. made an unsolicited bid for the company in a deal that would be valued at $815 million (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/gannett-discloses-bid-to-buy-tribune-for-63-premium-2016-04-25).

Express Scripts Holding Co.(ESRX) and Pioneer Natural Resources Co.(PXD) are among companies slated to release results after the bell.
Apple Inc.(AAPL) reports earnings on Tuesday and is expected to report its first year-over-year decline in iPhone unit sales (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-investors-brace-for-first-decline-in-iphone-sales-2016-04-22).

Other markets: Stocks in Asia and Europe closed lower (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-equities-trip-on-worries-about-a-wave-of-corporate-defaults-2016-04-25).
The dollar dropped (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-stumbles-as-yen-pulls-back-after-rapid-depreciation-2016-04-25) against most other major currencies, sending the ICE dollar index down 0.4% to 94.7570.

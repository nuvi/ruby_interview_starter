Jessica Chastain struggled to hight in heels on ‘The Huntsman’   
LONDON, Apr 25: Actress Jessica Chastain says she was constantly stumbling on the set of “The Huntsman: Winter’s War” because she had to fight in shoes with hidden high heels. The star portrays Chris Hemsworth’s wife in the “Snow White and the Huntsman” prequel, and the all-action role required Chastain, who is best known for her dramatic work, to undergo weeks of intense fight training. However, the 39-year-old actress was thrown off when she arrived on set for her first day and learned she would have to pull off all of her stunts wearing heels, so she wouldn’t look too short next to her leading man, who towers over her at six feet, three inches, reported Contactmusic.“I had worked in New York with someone Universal (studio bosses) had sent (to learn how to fight onscreen), then I went to London for three weeks to work with the stunt team, and I was feeling confident,” she said.“And then Chris shows up, who’s like 6’5 or something, and (costume designer) Colleen Atwood had built these shoes that look like flats, but they’ve got about four and a half inches hidden inside!” (PTI) Share this:

There is a rather tortured and tortuous piece on a pop cultural Jewish “Secret History” by Seth Rogovoy in the Forward featuring Madonna as the kabbalistic link between Judaism and the television series, Game of Thrones : “Madonna, perhaps the world’s most famous ‘follower of Kabbalah’, whatever that means, drew a connection between the biblical figure of Esther, the hero of the Purim story (and presumably Madonna’s personal hero, since she adopted the name Esther as her ‘Kabbalah name’), and the feminist hero of Game of Thrones , Daenerys Targaryen, aka the Mother of Dragons. . . . Like Esther and Madonna before her, Daenerys starts out as a quiet, meek teenager before finding inside herself reserves of ruthless power and strength she never imagined.&quot;
He also points out that American Jewish University in Los Angeles now offers a Game of Thrones course “in the Bible: Kings &amp; Queens, Duty &amp; Love, Truth &amp; Corruption,” taught by Rabbi Richard Camras of Shomrei Torah Synagogue in West Hills.
From my point of view, the more telling analogy to Game of Thrones is non-kabbalistic, i.e., with the ragged, bloody, exhausting GOP presidential nomination contest in which all the decent or at least half-good or tolerable candidates will soon have been vanquished, leaving standing only the politically despicable Donald Trump over whom the talented actor who stars as the diminutive Tyrion towers in all moral respects.
Let us hope that even a fifth marriage to Dragon Lady Daenerys—or to Queen Esther—would not be enough to save The Donald from his comeuppance at the hands of feminism’s underappreciated secret weapon, Hillary, who may yet emerge as our Dowager Empress if-and-when hubbie Bill consumes his next-and-last supersized McDonald’s.

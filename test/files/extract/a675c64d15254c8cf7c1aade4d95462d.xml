Fire Rips Through Banning&apos;s Notorious Homeless Encampment The early morning fire at &quot;The Compound&quot; destroyed part of the property.   
BANNING, CA- For years, the vacant buildings along Lincoln Street which comprise the Banning Business Center have become an eyesore on the community. And for years, the area homeless population have been moving in, transforming it into &quot;The Compound.&quot; 
But early Monday morning, all of that literally went up in flames. 
At 2:16 a.m., the Riverside County Fire Department received word of a commercial structure fire at the center. By the time fire crews arrived on scene, about half of one of the two-story structures was engulfed in flames, and the fire had spread into the nearby grass field, officials report. 
According to Jennifer Fuhrman of the Riverside County Fire Department, a total of eight &quot;businesses&quot; were damaged in the fire. 
&quot;The wind has been an issue for fire suppression operations although the forward rate of spread for both the interior and exterior fire has been stopped,&quot; she reported at 4:11 a.m. 
By 9 a.m., crews had finally cleared the scene, after several hours of mop up. No injuries were reported, and damages were estimated at $700,000. The cause remains under investigation, according to Furhman. 
There have been several small fires at the site before. Those fires were likely the result of transients trying to get warm or cook, Banning police Sgt. Michael Loader said 
Dozens of homeless people are believed to live at the site, as documented in the video below. (Warning, there is a profane word at the beginning) &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;!- -&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 
Earlier this year, the location was approved for receivership, according to the Record Gazette.

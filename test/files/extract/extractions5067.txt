Tom Brady suspension reinstated by court Associated Press , WTLV 4:10 PM. GMT April 25, 2016 NEW YORK, NY - AUGUST 31: Quarterback Tom Brady of the New England Patriots leaves federal court after contesting his four game suspension with the NFL on August 31, 2015 in New York City. U.S. District Judge Richard Berman had required NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and Brady to be present in court when the NFL and NFL Players Association reconvened their dispute over Brady&apos;s four-game Deflategate suspension. The two sides failed to reach an agreement to their seven-month standoff. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Photo: Getty Images) CONNECT   
NEW YORK (AP) - A federal appeals court has ruled that New England Patriots Tom Brady must serve a four-game &quot;Deflategate&quot; suspension imposed by the NFL, overturning a lower judge and siding with the league in a battle with the players union. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday in New York. The decision by a three-judge panel may end the legal debate over the scandal that led to months of football fans arguing over air pressure and the reputation of one of the league&apos;s top teams. It is also likely to fuel a fresh round of debate over what role, if any, the quarterback and top NFL star played in using underinflated footballs at the AFC championship game in January 2015. The appeals ruling follows a September decision by Manhattan Judge Richard Berman that went against the league, letting Brady skip the suspension. Loading...

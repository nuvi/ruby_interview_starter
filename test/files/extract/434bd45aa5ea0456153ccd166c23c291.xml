Ethan Cesarz Ethan Cesarz was able to spend Saturday with just about every member of Wisconsin&apos;s 2017 recruiting class while in Madison for the Badgers&apos; spring game.
Despite being the lone junior from the group without a scholarship from UW, the 6-foot-1, 205-pound linebacker from Delavan-Darien understood being in that company made him an important target for the staff.
&quot;It was a little discouraging at first knowing that I haven&apos;t even gotten one offer yet and these guys had plenty and were already committed to Wisconsin,&quot; Cesarz told BadgerBlitz.com. &quot;But they&apos;re great guys and told me that I&apos;m obviously here for a reason, so I wasn&apos;t too worried about that and it was a lot of fun with them.
&quot;I&apos;m very optimistic about an offer coming but when that is, I&apos;m not sure.&quot;
Cesarz, who had 149 tackles as a junior, was able to tour the school, facilities and talked to the coaches while on campus.
&quot;The visit was absolutely amazing,&quot; Cesarz said. &quot;Right away we were told about all of the great things about Wisconsin. It was very impressive. We toured the academic side of the building, which was incredible. The locker rooms were great and so was the weight room and nutrition bar. We also went on a bus ride to tour the campus and that was also great.
&quot;I thought the feedback was pretty good. They said they were really impressed with my film and loved watching it. They also talked about visiting me at school sometime and also told me I&apos;m a great player and I have great character.&quot;
Cesarz is hoping to see his first scholarship come in this summer.
&quot;Recently North Dakota State and Northern Illinois have reached out to me,&quot; Cesarz said. &quot;Northern Arizona and more Division 2 schools have also reached out to me. I haven&apos;t taken any visits this spring, although I had a visit to Iowa in the fall and Central Michigan a couple months ago. NDSU talked about coming and visiting me and a teammate this spring.
&quot;Right now I&apos;m always open to any other schools, of course, but Wisconsin definitely has most of my interest.&quot;
The Badgers currently have nine commitments in the current cycle.

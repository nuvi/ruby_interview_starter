Super League star Danny Brough knows Huddersfield Giants have to remain positive 17:00, 25 Apr 2016 Leeds Rhinos will be beaten if the attitude is right Shares Get daily news by email Danny Brough kicks a drop goal in the defeat at Wigan. Picture by John Rushworth 
Danny Brough knows the Huddersfield Giants can’t afford to feel sorry for themselves as their hopes of securing a Super 8s spot begin to fade further away. 
Huddersfield were unable to back up their 11-0 win over leaders Warrington Wolves as they suffered a morale-sapping 26-19 defeat at Wigan to remain two points adrift at the foot of the 2016 top-flight table with 10 defeats from their opening 12 games. 
But Brough is confident that if the Giants can remain positive and build on the positives of their narrow defeat to the Warriors, there’s no reason why they won’t climb off the bottom with a home win over fellow surprise strugglers Leeds Rhinos on Friday night. 
“We felt we deserved at least a point from the Wigan game, but some tough calls and the bounce of the ball went against us,” said the in-form goalkicking half-back.

“Unfortunately, that’s the way it seems to be when you’re going through a tough patch, nothing ever seems to go your way. 
“The key is to make sure we don’t feel sorry for ourselves and instead focus on the positives from that game. 
“Our performances in the win at Warrington the other week and then the narrow defeat at Wigan were ones which show we are heading in the right direction again. 
“If we keep building on those and show the same grit and determination that was on display when we twice went down to 12 men against Wigan, then we’ll put ourselves in a strong position to beat Leeds on Friday night. 
“It’s just a case of making sure we keep our heads up, because we know that if we do get it right on the night against Leeds we’ll get the result we’re all desperate to achieve.”

No soup for you: Man upset after restaurant runs out of soup A Texas lawyer upset that he wasn&apos;t provided a cup of soup during a recent meal has notified a restaurant owner that he&apos;ll sue if not reimbursed the $2.25 for the soup. Comment SJ News Online - St. John, KS By Associated Press Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 11:30 AM By Associated Press Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 11:30 AM A Texas lawyer upset that he wasn&apos;t provided a cup of soup during a recent meal has notified a restaurant owner that he&apos;ll sue if not reimbursed the $2.25 for the soup. Dwain Downing also is seeking $250 in attorney fees for the time spent drafting a letter sent to Benji Arslanovski, who operates Our Place Restaurant in the Fort Worth suburb of Mansfield. Downing says the soup was listed on the menu as part of a Saturday special. He says the restaurant offered no discount or substitution when it ran out. The lawyer argued the menu amounts to a contract with the customer and Arslanovski violated the terms of the contract. But the restaurateur says the menu makes clear the soup comes with a meal &quot;while supplies last.&quot; By Associated Press SJ News Online - St. John, KS By Associated Press

A third of British women have admitted wearing shoes on a night out that they know will stop them walking for TWO DAYS afterwards. 
The shocking statistics were revealed in a recent survey by Long Tall Sally, which claimed up to 8 million women could be hobbling around days after a night out - all because of their shoes. 
The company&apos;s If the Shoe Fits survey also found that a third of women own a pair of shoes that can only be worn to sit down events and three quarters own at least one pair of shoes which are &quot;absolute agony&quot; to wear.

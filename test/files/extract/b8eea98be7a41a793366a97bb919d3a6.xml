The U.S. Department of Agricultures Food and Nutrition Service issued a final rule Monday that will affect more than 3 million kids in daycare centers across the country. The regulation will only allow daycare centers to serve juice once a day, will ban fried foods, and encourages centers to not add honey to a childs yogurt. 
The regulation is a result of the 2010 law aimed at school lunches, a top priority of Mrs. Obamas Lets Move anti-obesity initiative. The government hopes the new rule will help children build healthy habits. 
This final rule updates the meal pattern requirements for the Child and Adult Care Food Program to better align them with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, as required by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, the final rule states. This rule requires centers and day care homes participating in the Child and Adult Care Food Program to serve more whole grains and a greater variety of vegetables and fruit, and reduces the amount of added sugars and solid fats in meals. 
The law required the USDA to promote health and wellness in child care settings via guidance and technical assistance that focuses on nutrition, physical activity, and limiting electronic media use, according to the regulation. 
The final rule will apply to participating organizations in USDAs Child and Adult Care Food Program, which reimburses centers for meals and snacks. Over 3.3 million children and 120,000 adults participate in the program every day. (Excerpt) Read more at freebeacon.com ... KEYWORDS: ban ; lunch ; michelle ; rules Here&apos;s the deal. Free Republic exists for you, and because of you. Without the generosity of people like you, Free Republic would wither and die. Then where would you go to find a group of like-minded people, standing for the values and principles of conservatism, spreading the word about those who would tear down our way of life, and just plain having fun? 
Free Republic doesn&apos;t have the financing of some billionaire, hidden in the background. Free Republic is &quot;grass roots&quot; all the way. We&apos;re not looking for 10 donors with $10,000 each, but we sure could use 10,000 donors with $10 each. The dollar amount may be the same, but the difference is in how we get there. 
WE NEED YOU! Anything you can give is so greatly appreciated. If you can become a monthly donor, that is fabulous. If five dollars is what you can manage, bring it! Your on-going support is crucial, and our thanks to you are immeasurable. 
God bless,

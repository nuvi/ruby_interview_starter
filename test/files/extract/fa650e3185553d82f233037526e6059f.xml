Rob Kardashian happy with Blac, Kylie friendship   
LOS ANGELES, Apr 25: Reality Tv star Rob Kardashian is thrilled his fiancee Blac Chyna has become friends with his half-sister Kylie Jenner after they became entangled in an on-going feud. The 28-year-old sock designer was torn between his lover and the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star – who is currently dating the model’s ex-fiance Tyga, with whom she has three-year-old son King Cairo – but is thrilled they have now decided to bury the hatchet and become friends. Taking to his Instagram account, the once-reclusive star uploaded a photograph of the former arch-enemies posing for a photograph together alongside the caption: “So happy my girls finally got to talk and make peace! #MyFamily #AllLove (sic).” Blac, 27, and 18-year-old Kylie set tongues wagging earlier this week when the reality TV star posed for a selfie with the model on Snapchat before sharing the image on Instagram. She captioned it, “When we’ve been best friends the whole time,” before swiftly deleting the photo from her account. Blac quickly followed suit by uploading a string of pictures with the Kylie’s Cosmetics businesswoman; one of a face-swap and another mirror shot. Meanwhile, it’s believed Rob’s sister Kim Kardashian West was the person who encouraged the pair to call a truce. (PTI) Share this:

Featured Features News Opinion BEAUTY BAY’S #TheChangingFaceOfBeauty CAMPAIGN DOESN’T REFLECT A CHANGE… 
Women of colour are not represented in the mainstream media. Despite this, hashtags such as #UnfairAndLovely, #BlackOut and #BeingADarkSkinGirl have been used to start conversations about this discrimination as well as to celebrate WoC. 
On 19 March, Beauty Bay launched their campaign called #TheChangingFaceOfBeauty , which shows older women as well as young. Phase 3 of #TheChangingFaceOfBeauty has launched and you don&apos;t want to miss out on this: https://t.co/crlyEXrq72 pic.twitter.com/IBgf2W52Mg

Dani Nicholls, student and blogger at missionworldie was vocal on Twitter and Instagram about Beauty Bay ‘s campaign. I love BB + this campaign, yet it&apos;s horrendously unrepresentative. The not so changing face of beauty 🙈 @WOCBeautyUK https://t.co/9rpPdqLyXY

People have supported Nicholls’ statement. @beautybay this is no way diverse enough for the hashtag.. What about WOC and those who are very fair? Different body types and sizes?

Nicholls’ told SYT that she tweeted about the campaign as it “wasn’t representative.” The blogger wanted to find out “why it didn’t represent the faces of beauty I know and see everyday in the UK.” 
Beauty Bay responded to Nicholls’ remarks on Instagram. They stated that they have “love for all races” and their campaign is about “how beauty transcends all ages, races, sizes and shapes – which is why we’ve used models ranging from size 6-16 and from multiple ethnic backgrounds.”

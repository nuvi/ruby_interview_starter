New Music – S’Express – Enjoy this Trip SHARE ON: Adrian Barr — April 25, 2016 
Mark Moore’s career reads like many respected artists through musical history. From humble beginnings as a DJ at a small club (after being asked to fill in one night) he wowed the crowd and was given a residency, this would be the beginning of what later would see him playing a pivotal role in the UK dance scene. One of the first Djs to bring Chicago house and Detroit techno to Britain after playing at the notorious ‘heaven’ nightclub’. Mark went on to form S’Express with co-producer Pascal Gabriel. Not only would they go on to produce the number one dance hit ‘The Theme from S-Express’ but also importantly see new artists coming into the fold such as Billie Ray Martin who’s vocals featured on the ‘Original Soundtrack’ album we would also see William Orbit and Carl Craig supplying additional production on the follow-up album ‘Intercourse’. As an Artist with a firm reputation as a DJ and producer in the dance scene, he has become one of the go to remixers for artists such as Prince, Erasure, Randy Crawford, Soft Cell and The B52s, this giving you an idea of how far his skills have reached in the industry. 
So what do we have here….. 
S’Express – Enjoy this Trip 
A collection of remixes from Throbbing Gristle, Tom Furse (The Horrors), Horse Meat Disco and Ray Mang plus two reworks, this is definitely a trip. There’s a good mixture of a back to ’89 house style through to the present club sound over the remixes and the down tempo reworks finish the collection off nicely. Personal favourites are too many to mention, check out ‘Mantra Mania’ (Monarchy Remix) which just kicks, there’s a quality oldskool hands in the air breakdown which drops back into club heaven, also ‘COMA’ (Cult With No Name Remodel) a laid back jazz intro of trumpet and piano which layers on strings and ethereal emotive vocals, simply wonderful. You get a sense that all involved in this collection put in a 100% with no phone in productions, a real treat to hear that S’Express sound re-worked. Only one thing left to say really, 
DROP THAT GHETTO BLASTER 
Have a listen to: S’Express – Lollypop (Chris &amp; Cosey Remix)

Sunday, 28 February 2016 Nice - Gorgeous View from the &quot;Grande Roue&quot; during Carnival I, like many of the locals here in Nice, avoid carnival! It has become too commercial and is more for visitors we feel than for us locals. But friends came into town and I wanted to meet my friends&apos; new little baby boy, so we dared to venture into town for lunch and a wander. Then, a friend&apos;s four year old fancied going up into the Ferris wheel on Place Massena. Despite having lived here for on and off 10 years, I have never gone up on the wheel (La Grande Roue) in French so G and I decided to fork out the 7.50€ each and take in the gorgeous view. Random Zorro man annoyed my husband by suggesting I come for a ride. Each year the carnival has a theme and this year the King is the King of the media. In previous years they have made fun of all sorts of people including the President Francois Hollande, DSK etc. Can be quite amusing sometimes :) The King of Carnival. His Queen. View from the Ferris Wheel. Getting up on the Grande Roue is worth the money on such a beautiful day, the view is just stunning! Helps that Nice is beautiful ;) Friends have also been up at night which they say is lovely, and I think I might have to go back up on a day with a beautiful sunset, it would be utterly amazing. The view down the Theatre de Verdure / Jardin Albert Premier down to the water. Just beautiful and we were lucky with the lovely weather. The view the other side over the Old Town (Vieux Nice) to the Quai des Etats Unis, the Chateau hill and the water. I love the colourful buildings and red rooftops. Europe is amazing for maintaining and protecting our heritage. Love this shot - over to the Port / Mont Boron behind the castle hill. Straight ahead to the two-tone water, something so specific to this area with the lighter turquoise and darker blue. I love the view to the hills behind Nice, I don&apos;t really know of many other places where you can see the mountains and the sea at the same time! A view down the Coulee Verte which is a great addition to the centre of Nice, so much nicer than the parking and bus station that used to be there! It is always full of locals with the retied sitting in chairs in the sun watching the world go by, kids playing on the wooden toys and it is is just so much nicer to walk through when going through the centre of town, peaceful and buzzing at the same time. So many colours :) What do you think? Have you been up? Have you been to Carnival? at

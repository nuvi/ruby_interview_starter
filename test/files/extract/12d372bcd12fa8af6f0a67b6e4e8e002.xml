DreamWorks has signed the “Assassin’s Creed” writing team of Adam Cooper and Bill Collage for World War II drama “ The Noble Assassin ,” Variety has learned exclusively. 
Cary Fukunaga is directing the film, based on the forthcoming novel by Paul Kix. Producers are Carla Hacken, Anonymous Content’s Michael Sugar — who won the Academy Award Best Picture for “Spotlight”— along with Fukunaga. 
HarperCollins is publishing Kix’s novel in February. It’s centered on a French aristocrat who becomes an anti-Nazi saboteur trained by the British Special Operations Executive. 
DreamWorks began working on the project in 2014 with Fukunaga attached direct and Scott Silver writing. Since then, he directed, wrote and produced Netflix’s war drama “Beasts of No Nation.” 
Fukunaga also won an Emmy for directing the first season of HBO’s “True Detective.” 
Cooper and Collage have been busy of late, working with director Anton Cjorbin on their adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize winning “Devil in the Grove” at Lionsgate; the historical drama “Guernica” for Venezuelan helmer Alberto Arvelo (“La Libertador”) and LD Entertainment; and “The General,” the story of George Washington crossing the Delaware for director Martin Scorsese and Red Granite Pictures. 
Their adaptation of the Ubisoft video game title “Assassin’s Creed,” starring Michael Fassbender and Marion Cottilard,” is slated to hit theaters Dec. 21 through Fox. The duo also has credits on “Exodus: Gods and Kings” and “The Divergent Series: Allegiant.” 
Cooper and Collage are represented by WME.

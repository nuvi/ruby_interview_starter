CONTACTO This New iPhone Keyboard Lets You Text One-Handed But Would You Actually Use It? 
My biggest gripe with newer cell phones is that they keep getting bigger, and bigger. Sure, market data suggests that most users want a bigger screen, and that’s great and all, but I would much rather use my phone with one hand. Texting one handed is almost impossible (unless you’re good with Swype, which is just the f*cking worst) on a big phone, so it looks like that’s out the window for me, because screens are just going to keep getting bigger. 
But what if there was another solution? Like completely redesigning the smartphone keyboard so you can work it with one hand? 
That’s what Microsoft’s done with its newest one-handed keyboard – for the iPhone. 
It might seem like a weird business strategy to develop apps for the iPhone, when Microsoft has its own phones that nobody uses, but then again, it makes perfect sense when you consider that no one uses MS phones. 
The new keyboard is called Word Flow , and it’s free to download for all iPhone users. As you can see from the handy-dandy vine video above, this bad boy doubles as a regular keyboard and a one-handed one as well that can be adjusted for left or right-handed users.

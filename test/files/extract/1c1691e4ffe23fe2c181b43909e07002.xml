PATERSON — When Jorge Cortes opened his restaurant, La Tia Delia, 28 years ago on the corner of Mill and Market streets, it was only one of two Peruvian restaurants in the area. 
Fast forward nearly three decades and the neighborhood now boasts more than a dozen Peruvian eateries and many more travel agencies, bakeries and specialty shops catering to those from the Andean State. 
On Tuesday, the city council will vote on a resolution designating the area by Mill, Market, Main and Cianci streets as &quot;Peru Square.&quot; Residents hope the designation will draw tourists similar to the way the &quot;Little Italy&quot; designation has done in other cities, and give recognition to immigrants who have called this part of Paterson home. 
&quot;This is something important to us, it gives recognition to a group of people who came to Paterson, settled and contributed here,&quot; said Nelly Hidalgo Celi, a Peruvian and city council planning board member. &quot;Since the late 1940&apos;s, Peruvians have stayed here and created a community.&quot; 
If the resolution passes, Celi said, this would be the first designated neighborhood in Paterson and would show one of the positive things happening in the city. 
The idea was first floated by Maria Del Pilar Rivas, a community leader who once ran for city council, eight years ago. At the time, the administration and the city council were not supportive of the idea, the group said. Other prominent Peruvians in the community have formed a group since then to push the designation forward. 
Now, the group says the moment is right and believe the city council will approve the idea Tuesday. If so, they hope to have a ribbon cutting and sign installed before the annual Peruvian Parade in July. 
Business owners in the area said they agree with the idea and hope the designation will bring more people to the square, which was bustling this past Saturday. 
&quot;It&apos;s beautiful, I love the idea,&quot; Griselda Chavez, owner of Griselda&apos;s, said. &quot;It&apos;s good for us as restaurant owners and as Peruvians.&quot; 
There are an estimated 10,000 Peruvians in Paterson, according to U.S. Census data from 2014. Celi says consulate officials have the number as high as 30,000. After Florida, New Jersey has the highest concentration of Peruvians in the nation, according to the Pew Research Center. 
In 2010, Keiko Fujimori, a Peruvian presidential candidate, came to Paterson to give a speech before the election. 
Alfredo Gracia, a professor of language and culture at William Paterson College, said Peruvians know this is their neighborhood. 
&quot;The Peruvian community knows when they want to eat anything Peruvian, they come here,&quot; Gracia, who came from Peru 43 years ago, said. 
Rivas backed that up, saying when her husband lived in Virginia, he drove six hours to the area just for authentic Peruvian ceviche.

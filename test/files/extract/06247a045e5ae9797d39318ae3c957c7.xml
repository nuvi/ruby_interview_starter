Based on the cult John Waters movie set in 1960s Baltimore, the show concerns the full-figured Tracy Turnblad whose fondest wish is to appear on a local television dance program.
Hudson, who will play Motormouth Maybelle, is currently in the Broadway revival of &quot;The Color Purple.&quot; She won an Oscar and Golden Globe in 2007 in the hit film &quot;Dreamgirls.&quot;
Fierstein, who is also writing the teleplay, will cross-dress and play Edna Turnblad, Tracy&apos;s mother, a role he created and won a Tony Award for in the stage version of &quot;Hairspray.&quot;
The new live musical will be directed for TV by Alex Rudzinski, who helmed &quot;Grease Live!&quot; Kenny Leon will direct the stage show.

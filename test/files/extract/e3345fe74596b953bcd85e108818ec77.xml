AFTER weeks of worry, organisers of Throckmorton Air Show have been given to go-ahead for this year&apos;s event to get off the ground. 
Regulations changes to &apos;safety measures&apos; by the Civil Aviation Authority seven weeks ago had the show&apos;s future hanging in the balance. Organisers, who all have full time jobs elsewhere, had spent months organising the June 11 airborne spectacular, only to be told there was a possibility that display lines and Risk Assessments would have to be amended, along with a £10,000 hike in charges proposed by the CAA. 
Show organisers suspected the changes were triggered by last August&apos;s air disaster in Shoreham, West Sussex, when former RAF pilot Andy Hill crashed a vintage jet. He survived but 11 people died. 
Thrilled organisers of the show are extremely happy to confirm that on April 20 the Civil Aviation Authority gave the nod for the show to continue. 
&quot;After several conversations with the Civil Aviation Authority and with no changes implemented, the organisers are pleased to announce the show’s future and everything that it stands for; raising money for charity, will be continuing. 
&quot;Airshows are the UK’s second largest outdoor activity, secondary only to football – and where else can you bring the whole family for such exciting outdoor entertainment on this scale, in Worcestershire,&quot; said one of the organisers, paramedic Samantha Jones. 
The Throckmorton Airshow is in it’s 9th year and this year’s show promises to be the biggest and best yet. 
Confirmed attendees so far include RAF Typhoon, BBMF, Team Raven, Tiger 9, King Air and Chinook, with many more to come. 
&quot;Despite the astronomical price increases from the CAA, the airshow team is keen to reassure everyone that ticket prices will not be affected. A new traffic management team has been put in place and all aspects of the show have been agreed with the Safety Advisory Group,&quot; Miss Jones added. 
This year the Throckmorton team is set to raise valuable funds for the Midlands Air Ambulance and RAFBF. Ms Jones is currently raising her own funds for the Great Western Air Ambulance through a series of challenges she has set herself including skydiving, wing-walking, mud runs, bungee jumps and swimming with sharks. 
Tickets are now available online at throckmortonairshow.co.uk. You can also keep up to date with announcements on twitter @TAirshow and Facebook . Share:

EMN DIMAPUR, APRIL 25 
So, this is how justice looks like. The tasteless misrepresentation of the idea of food-on-wheels currently being dragged across the town, via the Dimapur Municipal Council’s sceptic service truck, “Yesterday’s meals on wheels”, has finally been put in its rightful place. This tilt in the scales of justice has come about through the introduction of a food truck on the streets of Dimapur on Monday morning. It’s called Muffets on Wheels, and yes, it very much looks like justice. Muffets on Wheels is an extension of Muffet’s Pantry, located at Circular Road, Duncan Basti. It was around 11.30 am and 12 noon on Monday that the food-truck arrived outside the DC Court office, and announced itself to the residents of the area as well as the employees of the DC’s office at lunchtime. According to the proprietor of Muffet’s Pantry, Merenla Imkong, she decided to introduce the food-truck keeping in mind the “office-going people and students who could grab a proper meal” at the cost of less than Rs 100. The fast food items served from the truck include fried rice, pork noodles, burgers, hot dog, sandwiches, rolls and more. Merenla also informed that she has employed properly trained personnel to ensure that they serve “hygienic, hot and delicious foods at an affordable price. “ For this week, the food-truck will mainly operate around the DC Court office, from 11.30 am onwards. In the evening, the truck will roll towards City Tower and, from there, to Supermarket area. This route would be routine for this week. Further update on its route could be availed on its Facebook page. The food-truck was built by Zulu Designs, based in Notun Basti, Dimapur. Related posts:

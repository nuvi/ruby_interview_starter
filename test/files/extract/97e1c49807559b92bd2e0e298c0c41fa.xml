SEATTLE – Former Seattle sportscaster Tony Ventrella plans to challenge Rep. Dave Reichert, R-Wash., for his seat in Congress. 
Ventrella, a Democrat who caucused for Hillary Clinton, reportedly intends to follow the Bernie Sanders fundraising model of encouraging small donations from the public rather than big money donations or using political-action committees. The Seattle Times reports Ventrella decided to run after being turned off by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s insistence that he needed to raise big money. 
“It is my top priority to get big money influence out of politics. Once we do that, we can work together to solve the issues that mean so much to you and me,” said Ventrella on Facebook Monday. 
Kirkland businessman Santiago Ramos and business-consulting firm president Alida Skold have also reportedly filed to run in the 8th District. 
Ventrella has worked at several Seattle TV stations including KING. He recently left his job as a digital reporter for the Seattle Seahawks.

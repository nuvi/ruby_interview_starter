The world lost another music great in 2016 as it was announced that Jazz and Soul balladeer Billy Paul lost his battle with pancreatic cancer, Sunday. Paul [born Paul Williams], leaves behind the legacy of a career that lasted for six decades and saw him beat out Ray Charles and Curtis Mayfield to win 1972&apos;s Grammy Award for Best Male Rhythm &apos;n Blues Performance with the classic hit &quot;Me and Mrs. Jones&quot;. He was 81 years old. 
The Philly vocalist had a storied history in the industry, starting out in the Jazz scene where he collaborated with the likes of Charlie Parker and Dinah Washington as a teenager. On paper, his life as a young entertainer was short lived, as Paul was drafter to serve in the military in 1957, but even then he found himself involved with the music, as it is said that he was stationed at the same base as Gary Crosby and Elvis Presley. The friendship the men forged led Crosby to join Paul in forming the Jazz Blues Symphony Band . His most notable collaboration though, was a historic one that helped engineer a new sound. In 1971 he hooked up with super producers Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff back in his home city, and along with the O&apos;Jays, Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes, and Lou Rawls, innovated the &quot;Philadelphia Soul&quot; movement. 
&quot;[Paul&apos;s voice] made him one of the great artists to come out of Philly and to be celebrated worldwide,&quot; the legendary production duo said in a statement late Sunday. &quot;Our proudest moment with Billy was the recording of the salacious smash &apos;Me and Mrs. Jones.&apos; In our view, it is one of the greatest love songs ever recorded.&quot; 
Paul is survived by his wife, Blanche Williams and their two kids.

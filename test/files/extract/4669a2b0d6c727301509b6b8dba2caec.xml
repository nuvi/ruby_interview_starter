Briana Jungwirth has seen some really major changes occur in her life, since she first met Louis Tomlinson last year and in a new interview her cousin has revealed that the blonde beauty had no idea what she was getting into. 
The LA stylist hooked up with One Direction singer Louis last March when he was in LA with friends. It’s been revealed that she was introduced to the hunk by her cousin, who was dating Tommo’s friend Oli at the time. 
The relationship was short lived and lasted only a few weeks but in that time Bri fell pregnant and she’s since given birth to their son Freddie Reign. 
Jungwirth has been harassed and abused on social media since news of her pregnancy broke in the press last year and she’s been labelled everything from a gold-digger to a fame hungry wannabe. However, in an interview with Now magazine her cousin has revealed that the truth is very different. 
It turns out that Bri didn’t even know who Louis was when she first met him. She was more of a Harry Styles fan it seems. 
Ashley Jessica told the magazine that there was ‘something special’ between Louis and Briana from the moment they met, but insisted that it wasn’t ever about his fame or career. She explained: ‘We’ve been branded fame hungry and racist, which couldn’t be further from the truth. The rumours I’ve read are crazy. It’s been intense. We have paparazzi in our personal space trying to follow us to Briana. I’ve had groups of girls shout abuse at me in Barnes and Noble. People think we’re a horrible family because they believe the false information they read online and it’s just not true. We’re all fictional characters to these people.’

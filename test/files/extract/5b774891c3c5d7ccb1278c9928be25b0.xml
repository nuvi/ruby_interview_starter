Monday, 29 February 2016 Meatless Monday - Veggie Pasta Soup This is one of my favourite soup dishes (maybe because it has pasta in it :) ). I had it first at an Italian friend&apos;s place and have loved it ever since. Versatile and easy, you pick whichever veggies you have on hand and throw them in! Just make sure you have a small pasta shape in your pantry at all times. Read on for more tips :) Here are the veggies I decided to use but you are of course free to add whatever you have and want to use, I just like this more wintery combo. You will need a frying pan and a bigger pasta / soup saucepan. Start by slicing up the leeks and banging up the garlic a bit by pressing down on it with a wide bladed knife. Chop up all the veggies very small, into small cubes. I tend to store the harder veggies together as they will go into the stock around the same time. And the softer ingredients (mushrooms and tomatoes - I used cherry as it is winter so we have lower quality tomatoes) plus the peppers / chillies - also all in little cubes. The size is actually important - so they cook quickly and are the same size as the pasta shapes. I fried off the leeks with the garlic in a pan with some olive oil and lashings of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. I let them cook on a medium heat until the leeks have softened and started to brown slightly in places. In the mean time I have put the soup pan on the stove with the veggie stock and get it to simmering before adding in the harder veggies (potatoes, carrots and courgettes). Then I add the small slices of mushroom (I prefer to get the firm button mushrooms so they retain some texture and don&apos;t go all soggy) into the pan with the leeks so they cook a little. Done. As you can see, my stock with potatoes, carrots and courgettes is now on a slow boil. Check that the veggies are getting tender, they should retain bite in the final dish so don&apos;t overcook them here as we still have various ingredients to add and the pasta will take around 5 minutes also. In go the peppers and I fancied some heat to it so I added some red chilies too. But I also wanted some herby goodness in there so I added Herbes de Provence to add depth to the soup. In it goes and I fancied some more black pepper so that went in too. Get the stock back up to a slow boil. Add in the tomatoes, they really don&apos;t need long and they flavour the soup with a lovely sweetness. Add in the leeks and mushrooms from the pan. Looks yummy already :) Then the pasta goes in. It says 8 minutes but it continues to cook on the table as it is in hot stock, so I cooked it for less time. I like my pasta al dente and the worst thing is for it to go to mush. A tip is that if you aren&apos;t going to eat all the soup that night, take some of it and keep it aside and freeze it (we did) as if you put the pasta into the whole amount of the soup, it will go totally mushy if you reheat it. I think this is a slightly strange but cute shape - little butterflies, farfalline. In it goes and bring it to a proper boil this time. Test it is al dente, even a little on the crunchy side of al dente, and isn&apos;t it so cute with the different veggies in each spoonful! Finished and served (in a smaller pot as you can see - the rest being in the freezer for a night where we don&apos;t feel like cooking). Served and it was gorgeous. The textures of the different veggies make every mouthful interesting and the flavours are great. Love it! The carrots are sweet as are the tomatoes, the potatoes and mushrooms are earthy, the courgette and peppers are fresher. Some are still crunchy, others are satisfying soft and dense. Yum! All gone :) Do you make soup with pasta shapes? Any ideas or tips for me? Drop me a message below :)

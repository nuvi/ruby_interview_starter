Morgantown Social NetworX April 28 Happy Hour Headed to Yesterday’s 
April 25, 2016 Business News 
The next Morgantown Social NetworX (MSNX) Happy Hour will be the held at Yesterday’s Restaurant, Bar &amp; Grille on Thursday, April 28, from 5:30-8 p.m. 
Yesterday’s has a casual dining atmosphere, offering selections to meet everyone’s needs like the Little Motowners menu, fresh seafood and pastas, aged steaks, made-to-order sandwiches, salads and a wide assortment of appetizers, including the popular fresh guacamole and chips. 
The theme of the restaurant is the “yesterday” of Morgantown, and the restaurant is decorated with old photos, artifacts and posters reminiscent of an older, slower-paced lifestyle. Customers love the warm, inviting fireplaces, as well as the glass-enclosed patio, which also features a fire pit. The restaurant also has a custom-built bar and lounge decorated with sleek granite and wood. Large HD televisions on the patio and in the lounge provide customers with the opportunity to view their favorite sporting events while enjoying the relaxing atmosphere and quality food. The patio is also available for private parties and can seat up to 60 people. 
“Yesterday’s strives to bring you the very best in food and attentive service,” says Owner Shawn Owen. 
When creating the menu, Yesterday’s primary concern was providing its customers with the freshest ingredients in order to create a unique and consistent product. Some of the highlights include the peppercorn crusted seared-rare ahi-tuna, chicken marsala, hand-cut sweet potato wedges and white balsamic dressing as well as such classics as the jerk burger, sirloin steak hoagie, Cuban sandwich and pan-seared scallops. To complement the entrees, the restaurant offers a variety of desserts like chocolate cake, Italian almond cake, red velvet cake and the hometown favorite cinnamon-topped carrot cake. Yesterday’s bar has an extensive selection of wines by the bottle or by the glass, as well as spirits and beer to cater to each customer’s specific tastes. 
“Yesterday’s has a wonderful atmosphere and serves as a perfect venue for the MSNX group to gather for Happy Hour,” says Mary Lynn Ulch, founder of MSNX. “We are excited to bring the next MSNX happy hour to Yesterday’s.” 
The MSNX Happy Hours are open for anyone to attend, and each attendee is responsible for his or her own bill. For Happy Hour, the venue will offer specials for MSNX attendees, including $2.50 domestic bottles, $4 glasses of wine, $3.50 cocktails and half-off appetizers.

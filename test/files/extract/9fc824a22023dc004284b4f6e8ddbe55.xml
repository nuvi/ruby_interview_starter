DJ’s love life is getting more complicated. 
“One Life to Live” star John Brotherton has been upped to a series regular for season two of Netflix ’s “ Fuller House ” revival, Variety has learned. He plays Matt Harmon, the son of Dr. Fred Harmon (Robin Thomas) — and a love interest for DJ (Candace Cameron Bure). 
In the first season, Matt, now a successful, handsome veterinarian in his late 30s, returned home to visit his father. He hadn’t seen DJ since he was a little boy — and sparks fly again between him and DJ. 
The series was renewed for a second season just days after the debut of its first season on Netflix, amid huge response on social media. 
“Fuller House” hails from “Full House” creator Jeff Franklin. The 13-episode series is a modern-day spinoff of the beloved ’80s and ’90s family sitcom, revolving around the widowed D.J. Tanner-Fuller (Candace Cameron Bure), who is raising her three sons with the help of her younger sister Stephanie Tanner (Jodie Sweetin) and Kimmy Gibler (Andrea Barber). 
Cameron Bure, Sweetin and Barber lead the series, which drew back most of the original cast including Bob Saget, John Stamos, Dave Coulier and Lori Loughlin in recurring roles. The only cast members who did not return for the initial season were Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.

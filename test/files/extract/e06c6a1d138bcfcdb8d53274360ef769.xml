Close Gay woman says Family Dollar cashier refused to serve her A woman said she was denied service at a Family Dollar store after she took exception to comments made by the cashier.

NEW ORLEANS- The Family Dollar store on the corner of Canal and Broad has always been Melissa Langford&apos;s go-to for knick-knacks. But she says never again after her experience there this past Friday. 
&quot;The cashier was just loudly stating her opinion on her disdain for gay people,&quot; said Langford, &quot;Eventually I spoke up because I couldn&apos;t take it anymore.&quot; 
But Langford says the situation only got worse. 
In a cell phone video of the incident, the clerk can be heard saying, &quot;I&apos;m not serving them two.&quot; Lundford is then heard in the video saying, &quot;She won&apos;t serve me because I&apos;m gay and because he doesn&apos;t like anti-gay people.&quot; 
Langford says an appeal of the discrimination to the manager yielded no results, which led to a shouting match between the clerk and the supportive customer. Eventually, another clerk did ring up Langford and the other man, but Langford says the damage was done. 
&quot;I think everybody&apos;s entitled to think what they want, but as a representative of a company, like a national chain, it&apos;s completely inappropriate and a blatant disregard for other people&apos;s feelings,&quot; said Langford. 
When Eyewitness News called the store Sunday to inquire about the incident, the manager on duty claimed to know nothing about it. But Langford says she shared the story and video on social media so everyone could know about it. 
&quot;Just gets it put out into the air that us gay people are gonna stick together,&quot; she said. 
Langford says she&apos;ll take any kind of response from the company, from firing the clerk and manager to a simple apology, as long as someone acknolwedges how she was treated in this video was wrong. 
An email sent Sunday, to Family Dollar&apos;s corporate office, was not answered by news time Sunday night.

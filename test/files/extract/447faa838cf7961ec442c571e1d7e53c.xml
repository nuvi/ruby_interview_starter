GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. - This week is the U.S. Department of Justice&apos;s Reentry Week, an effort to focus of ways to get people who have served their jail time back into the community as productive members of society. 
The U.S. Attorney&apos;s Office, along with Grand Rapids Police and other law enforcement agencies met Monday morning to address the issue. 
Many ex-convicts, when released from prison, have little or no support group, very few resources and no jobs.

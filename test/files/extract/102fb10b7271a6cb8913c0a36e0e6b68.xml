PLYMOUTH — A Maine man charged with randomly shooting two people in Massachusetts and firing at a third was ordered Monday to be held for a 20-day mental health evaluation. Share E-mail this story Print this story Save this story Sponsor 
Lucas McPherson, 25, is accused of using a shotgun to commit the attacks before dawn Sunday in Duxbury, an affluent seaside community south of Boston that is more than 400 miles from his home in Mapleton. 
Not-guilty pleas to multiple charges including attempted murder were entered on his behalf at his arraignment in Plymouth District Court. 
McPherson&apos;s court-appointed attorney, Dennis Scollins, said his client doesn&apos;t appear to be mentally competent. 
Family members told police that he has schizophrenia and has not been taking his medication. 
McPherson has no known ties to the victims or to Duxbury, Police Chief Matthew Clancy said. 
The first victim was shot in the abdomen at about 1:15 a.m. as he drove through Duxbury, police said. He went to a nearby fire station for help. 
Officers investigating that shooting encountered another man who had been shot in the face and neck as he let out his dog about 20 minutes later, Clancy said. 
Their injuries aren&apos;t considered life-threatening. 
He also shot at a woman but missed, Clancy said. 
Police found McPherson in his vehicle near where the second man was shot. A shotgun was in the car, police said. McPherson came at an officer with a hunting knife but was subdued with a stun gun, Clancy said. 
Clancy said it was a miracle that no one was killed, including McPherson.

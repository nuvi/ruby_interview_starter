SINGAPORE--Singapore&apos;s consumer price index fell at a faster than expected pace in March, mainly due to a drop in petrol and car prices.
The consumer price index fell 1.0% year-on-year in March, compared with the median estimate for a 0.8% decline from a poll of five analysts by The Wall Street Journal, and a 0.8% fall in February.
The cost of transportation, which has an index weighting of 15.8%, fell 4.3% in March from a year earlier due to cheaper car and petrol prices, the data showed.
Housing and utilities costs, which make 26.3% of the index, fell 4.2% because of lower accommodation costs, reflecting the soft rental market in the island nation.
Food prices, which have a 21.7% weighting in the index, however, rose 2.2% on year in March from a 2.0% rise in February. The increase was mainly due to higher prices for uncooked food, including seafood, vegetables and meat, partly due to weather-related production disruptions in neighboring countries from which Singapore imports most of its food.
The central bank&apos;s core inflation measure, which excludes the costs of accommodation and private road transport, edged up to 0.6% in March from 0.5% a month ago, mostly on account of higher food inflation.
&quot;External sources of inflation are likely to remain muted given ample supply buffers in the major commodity markets and weak global demand conditions,&quot; the government and the Monetary Authority of Singapore said in a joint statement.
Core inflation is still expected to pick up over the course of the year, though at a slower pace than previously estimated, the government and central bank said.
The MAS eased its currency policy earlier this month, surprising analysts, as it expects the economy to slow further and core inflation&apos;s increases to be slower than it previously estimated.

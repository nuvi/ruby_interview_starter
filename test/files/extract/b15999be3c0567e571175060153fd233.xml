No new malaria case in European region – #WorldMalariaDay report Monday, April 25, 2016 Latest Punch Newspaper 
In 2015 there was no indigenous case of malaria in all countries in the World Health Organisation European Region, a new WHO report has said. The cases came down from 90000 cases in 1995. 
Coming a year after the World Health Assembly resolved to eliminate malaria from at least 35 countries by 2030, the new report shows that the goal of eliminating malaria though ambitious is also achievable. 
The report which was released on Monday to coincide with the 2016 World Malaria Day, also revealed that 21 countries are in a position to achieve the goal, including six countries in the African Region, where the burden of the disease is heaviest. 
Outside the European Region, eight countries reported zero cases of the disease in 2014: Argentina, Costa Rica, Iraq, Morocco, Oman, Paraguay, Sri Lanka and United Arab Emirates. 
Another eight countries each tallied fewer than 100 indigenous malaria cases in 2014. And a further 12 countries reported between 100 and 1000 indigenous malaria cases in 2014. 
The Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030 , approved by the World Health Assembly in 2015, calls for the elimination of local transmission of malaria in at least 10 countries by 2020.” a press release from WHO revealed. 
“Our report shines a spotlight on countries that are well on their way to eliminating malaria,” said Dr Pedro Alonso, Director of the WHO Global Malaria Programme. “WHO commends these countries while also highlighting the urgent need for greater investment in settings with high rates of malaria transmission, particularly in Africa. Saving lives must be our first priority.” 
Since the year 2000, malaria mortality rates have declined by 60 percent globally. In the WHO African Region, malaria mortality rates fell by 66 percent among all age groups and by 71 percent among children under five years.

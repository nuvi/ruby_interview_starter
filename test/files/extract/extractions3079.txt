Souq.com, Vitaene C, KitKat Top YouTube’s Most Watched Ads Posted on April 25, 2016 in Advertising 
Video advertisements has become an important part of defining a brand. Significant efforts and creativity is invested into the making of these ads. In an attempt to judge these ads, Think With Google publishes the most popular ads each month that are mainly based on paid views, organic views and audience retention. Souq.com tops the list in the March 2016 list. Souq.com: An ad created by souq.com and Good People emphasizes on the freedom of choice. The ad titled ‘Its yours’ is a impactful clip highlighting the satisfaction of shopping from Souq.com. Arabian Marketer had earlier posted details about the project. 
Vitaene C Competition 2016 : The creative agency, NETDE, along with the Media Agency, Oxford Design Advertising arranged a competition for the Vitaene C ad viewers, which would give them a chance to win three Jeep Wranglers and 5 holiday packages for two people to Dubai. 
KitKat senses with Hazlenut : The ad uses the pre-existing mouthwatering image of KitKat to introduce the new ‘Kitkat with hazlenut’. Surely the consumers do not need a second invitation. The ad is created by JWT with MEC Dubai as its media agency. 
Halwani Fillets : The cartoon themed advertisement, created by Mahdys, takes us into the ‘quality inspection’ for the chickens used for making the Halwani Filets. The ad manages to make the viewers smile and have their mouth-watering at the same time. 
Listerine Total Care Zero: The ad made by JWT shows how over a day we end up eating or drinking (or sometimes just chewing on) things that might leave our teeth in a vulnerable condition. The picture of Listerine ‘Soldiers’ fighting and cleaning out teeth is surely an image that would make the viewers reach out for Listerine more often than not. 
Unpacking S7: Samsung along with its creative agency Cheil highlights the impressive features of S7, especially the ones dealing with photography. The enhanced picture quality even under ‘not so suitable’ conditions does increase the artillery of this smartphone. 
iPhone 6s: Highlighting the application of hands-free Siri, the ad depicts a situation of using a timer on your iphone and passing your time while excruciatingly waiting for your delicacies to be baked. The ad is created by TBWA/Media Arts Lab 
El Maleka : The ad highlights the wide usage of this delectable option for pasta and lasagna to be cooked at home. The depiction of mothers using it gives it a homely feeling increasing the temptation for the product. The ad is created by Leo Burnett Egypt. 
Expo 2020: In March, the official logo for Expo 2020 was introduced by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. The inspiration for the design of the logo has been a 4000 year-old ring that was excavated from an archaeological site in Dubai. The media agency for Expo 2020 is Mindshare. 
Under Armour: The ad, featuring Michael Phelps, depicts the message of dedication and hard work for achieving one’s goal. The message in the ad is perhaps best captured by the logo of the product itself: ‘Its what you do in the dark that puts you in the light’. The creative agency for the ad is Garage366.

British astronaut Tim Peake became the first man and second person to finish a marathon in space on Sunday. 
Peake completed the 26.2-mile London Marathon in orbit about 200 miles above Earth at the International Space Station. He ran an estimated time of 3:35.21, according to a tweet from the European Space Agency . 
“It probably looked like I was having a strong run at the end, but the reality was that I couldn’t wait to get out of the harness!!” Peake said in a blog post Monday . . @astro_timpeake has finished his #LondonMarathon in space!

Peak explained in the post the harness used on the space station started to hurt his shoulders, so he ran at a faster pace. 
“My legs paid the price, but my shoulders were grateful,” Peake said.

“It’s a huge honor to be asked to be the official starter of the 2016 London Marathon,” Peake said before the start of the race. “I&apos;m really excited to be able to join the runners on earth from right here on board the space station. Good luck to everybody running, and I hope to see you all at the finish line.” 
Peake said he opted to watch BBC coverage of the event while running the marathon instead of watching the movie “2001: A Space Odyssey” or listening to his #Spacerocks playlist . 
“It was extremely motivating watching the live coverage of the event and hearing the stories of some of the 33,000 people taking part,” Peake said. 
The RunSocial app also gave Peake a view of the streets of London as he would see them if he were running the marathon on Earth. 
“It was an incredible experience to take part in such a prestigious event whilst orbiting the planet on the International Space Station and I&apos;m hugely grateful to everyone at the European Space Agency and NASA who made that happen,” Peake said.

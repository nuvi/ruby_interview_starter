Oil futures edged lower on Monday as traders took profits after a strong rally last week on signs that the global oil glut might start to ease in the coming months.
The market also weighed the potential impact of Saudi Arabia’s economic reform plan, which aims to reduce the kingdom’s reliance on oil.
West Texas Intermediate crude for delivery in June CLM6, -2.38% edged down by 27 cents, or 0.6%, to $43.46 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. June Brent crude LCOM6, -1.26% on London’s ICE Futures exchange fell a penny to $45.10 a barrel.
Saudi Arabia announced an economic reform plan Monday . The Saudi economy has been crimped by low crude price and the plan, dubbed “Vision 2030, is a long-term blueprint for the kingdom’s economic transformation aimed at reducing its dependence on oil.

Short term, there isn’t likely to be any change in regard to the impact on oil prices and fundamentals, said Robbie Fraser, commodity analyst at Schneider Electric. But it “reinforces the current understanding that Saudi Arabia cannot or will not attempt to use [the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting countries] as a tool to lift prices.”
Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in an interview aired on Saudi news channel Al-Arabiya Monday that “by 2020, we’ll be able to live without oil.” He also said that less than 5% of state-owned oil giant Saudi Arabia’s Oil Co. will be publicly sold off.
Last week, oil prices rose by nearly 5% as a three-day strike in Kuwait and hopes that the oil glut will slacken overrode disappointment about the failure of major oil nations to reach an agreement on freezing their production.
Traders were cashing in on those gains on Monday.
“Prices are down on profit-taking,” said Gao Jian, an oil analyst at Shandong-based SCI International. “Without any major news or catalysts, prices are going to seesaw in the near term.”
Markets were buoyed by signs last week that the global surplus in oil supplies is beginning to wane. The number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. dropped to 343 , a fall for the fifth consecutive week, according to Baker Hughes.
The International Energy Agency also said last week that it expects production from the U.S., China, Russia, Mexico, and Colombia to fall, helping to reset the supply-and-demand balance next year.
Still, the speed at which Iran and Libya ramp-up exports this year continues to be a blind spot for the market and could affect the rate of rebalancing.
Over the weekend, a company associated with the government running eastern Libya said that it was readying itself to export its first crude cargo, which could help kick-start the country’s return to the oil market. Oil exports from Libya have fallen dramatically since the fall of Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.
This week, traders will be eyeing the Federal Reserve policy meeting for an outlook on the U.S. economy. The market largely expects the committee to keep the benchmark rate unchanged, but indications of future policy have an effect across markets, from oil to bonds.
Back on Nymex, petroleum-product prices inched lower along with oil. May gasoline RBK6, -1.09% fell less than a cent, or 0.5%, to $1.523 a gallon, while May heating oil HOK6, -1.19% lost less than half a cent, or 0.4%, to $1.304 a gallon.
May natural gas NGK16, -3.60% traded at $2.073 per million British thermal units, down 6.7 cents, or 3.1%.

The Dubai-based boutique PR and digital brand activation agency, McCollins Media, has expanded the number of F&amp;B clients with the addition of Ruby Tuesday, Wakame and Mr. Greek. 
The agency was chosen to handle the accounts following a competitive pitch and, in addition to strategizing and generating coverage, will be responsible for building the brands among their target audience through social media and PR. 
“Our dedicated F&amp;B division has deep and varied industry knowledge to offer clients with innovative and result-oriented strategic communications campaigns. We pride ourselves on being a creative agency and coming up with out-of-the-box solutions to get our clients the necessary mileage,” said Meghna Kothari, Director, McCollins Media.

“The F&amp;B sector in the UAE is growing at an alarming rate, and the growth has been driven by a mix of expansion of existing chains as well as new brands and concepts entering the market. We are glad to be associated with the sector,” added Ms Kothari.

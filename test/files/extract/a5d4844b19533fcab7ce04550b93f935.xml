Jesse Tyler Ferguson’s Favorite New York Restaurants (And the One Place Even He Can’t Snag a Reso) April 25, 2016 1:33 pm Expand Photo: Getty Images / ABC 
Jesse Tyler Ferguson’s one-man show Fully Committed officially opens on Broadway at the Lyceum Theatre today, and in it, the Modern Family star plays the central role of Sam, a reservationist at one of New York’s hottest, most-hard-to-get-into restaurants. He also plays the other 39 characters in the script, including a strict head chef; the nervous front-of-house staff; and, of course, the crazy, craving, desperate callers who are just dying to get a table at any and all cost. 
Written by Becky Mode and directed by Jason Moore ( Pitch Perfect , Avenue Q ), Fully Committed offers a satirical look at foodie culture. In New York especially, there are the dictatorial chefs, the out-of-work actors serving plates of foam, and the diners—the most hilarious real-life characters of them all—whose urge to taste greatness, or so they think, is insatiable. And while there’s plenty to laugh at in both the fictional Fully Committed and its real-life counterparts, there are a select few restaurants in Manhattan that really are just downright amazing and, most important, totally worth the angst-ridden wait. 
Below, Ferguson shares his favorite tough-to-get-into places to eat in New York, the places that he’s waiting for, and the one where he still hasn’t managed to get past the velvet ropes.

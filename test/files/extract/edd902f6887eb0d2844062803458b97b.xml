Miami, Fort Lauderdale chambers of commerce may merge Two chambers of commerce might join as one Privacy Policy 
The Greater Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commece and the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce are exploring a merger. 
“There are already many existing synergies between our two groups, and by consolidating our powerbases we increase our ability to shape key issues regionally while continuing to address the matters that impact our local businesses and economy,” said Heiko Dobrikow, chair of the Greater Fort Lauderdale chamber and general manager of the Riverside Hotel, in Fort Lauderdale. 
Established in 1910, the Greater Fort Lauderdale chamber represents 1,311 companies. 
Christine Barney, chair of the Greater Miami group and CEO of rbb Communications. said her chamber has long served businesses from Palm Beach to the Keys. Many issues might be addressed better with a regional approach, she said. 
“This as a great opportunity to provide even better service, leadership and value for businesses throughout South Florida while allowing us to operate more cost effectively for our members,” Barney said. 
A task force is being created to explore the structure and operational issues required for the merge to move ahead, the groups said in a news release. A final determination will be made by Dec. 31.

Former Mowat Park girl vies for Mrs SA title These type of competitions create leaders and young women who believe in their abilities 8 hours ago LIndokuhle Ngwenya is hoping to reach the top at MRS SA competition. 
FORMER Montclair resident and Mowat Park old girl, Lindokuhle Ngwenya is making a name for herself as a contender in the Mrs South Africa competition. 
The 26-year-old oral hygienist has been on a mission of self-improvement since getting married on 26 September. “I don’t have any children at the moment, but I wanted to be someone my children could be proud of. I most importantly wanted to teach them that they could do whatever they set their minds to and I figured how could I teach that if I hadn’t proven it’s possible,” she said. What better way to do it than realise a long-life dream of becoming a model. She saw the opportunity to enter Mrs South Africa and took a leap of faith and landed herself in the top 100. 
So far the competition is going well, according to the budding model who is busy with gaining a fan-base who will follow and vote for her on Facebook approaching sponsors to invest in her as well as participating in charity events but the competitions did come with it’s challenges. “The biggest challenge was getting businesses to sponsor me. The best thing about this is that even when I got a no from other businesses, my belief in my dream didn’t falter. It encouraged me to work harder. I’ve changed in the best ways-I believe in my abilities,” she added. 
With all that is happening in her life, from being a newlywed and juggling a household and a job, she manages well thanks to the amazing support from her husband, Barry Ngwenya who has risen to the occasion and has proven to be her number one fan. “He works almost as hard as me so if and when I win, know that we’ve been working on winning together. For instance, currently I’m preparing for interviews which will take place at Emperors Palace on 28 April. The interviews will determine whether I continue on to the finals. So he’s been interviewing me and at times he even helps me with household chores,” she gushed. 
Through her everyday experiences in the competition, she encourages young girls who are interested in competing to go for it and do whatever makes your heart content. “Don’t let anyone’s opinions box you in. These type of competitions create leaders and young women who believe in their abilities and also encourage ladies who selflessly give of themselves, especially in the form of charity work,” said Ngwenya.

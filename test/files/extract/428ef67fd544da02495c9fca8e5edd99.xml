It&apos;s the ancient equivalent of &quot;don&apos;t worry, be happy.&quot; 
Turkish archaeologists have unearthed a 2,400-year-old mosaic that features a laid-back skeleton, reclining with a cup next to a bottle of wine and loaf of bread, surrounded by the wise words: &quot;Be cheerful, enjoy your life,&quot; according to Turkey&apos;s Anadolu news agency. 
Turkish media said that the image, which dates to the third century B.C., was discovered in 2012 during construction of a cable car in Antakya. The area was further excavated to look for additional artifacts. 
Archaeologist Demet Kara says that the carefree fellow likely appeared in the dining room of a wealthy family&apos;s villa in the ancient Greek-Roman city of Antioch, known as an early center of Christianity, and possibly the place where followers of Jesus Christ were first called Christians. 
She said that the mosaic was a unique finding for Turkey. 
&quot;There is a similar mosaic in Italy, but this one is much more comprehensive. It is important for the fact that it dates back to the 3rd century (B.C.),&quot; she is quoted as saying in local media. 
Its blissed-out message is a far cry from the &quot;memento mori&quot; -- stark reminders of the transience of life, symbolized by images of skulls and other grim reminders of mortality -- that populated medieval Europe. 
Rather, it seems to echo the &quot;Cleopatra Ode&quot; of Roman poet Horace, &quot;Nunc est bibendum&quot; -- now is the time for drinking.

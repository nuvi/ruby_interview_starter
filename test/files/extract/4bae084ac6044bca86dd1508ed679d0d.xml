Yemeni forces backed by troops from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have advanced into the al-Qaeda-held city of Al Mukalla and killed more than 800 fighters there, a Saudi-led military coalition said Monday.
The coalition&apos;s operation against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, known as AQAP, seeks to check the terrorist group&apos;s expansion along Yemen&apos;s southern coast. AQAP has controlled Al Mukalla since last April.
It marks a new direction for the coalition, which has focused largely on defeating the Iran-supported Houthi rebels. The U.A.E. is a member of the coalition.
Yemeni and U.A.E. troops advanced to the outskirts of the city of some 300,000 on Sunday before mediation by Islamic clerics led to a withdrawal by AQAP fighters who fled westward, according to a local security official familiar with the operation.
Saudi special forces also took part in the operation, the coalition said in a statement published by Saudi Arabia&apos;s state news agency.
A barrage of coalition airstrikes against AQAP targets over the weekend had paved the way for the assault, the security official said.
A coalition-allied commander in Al Mukalla told Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television later Sunday that the forces &quot;made progress in record time&quot; against AQAP, considered one of al Qaeda&apos;s most dangerous branches.
The commander, Maj. Awad Salmeen, said the forces had taken over the local airport and an oil terminal, and that the city&apos;s seaport was close to being under control.
Al Mukalla is al Qaeda&apos;s stronghold in Yemen and represents one of the group&apos;s most significant territorial holdings world-wide.
Maintaining control of the city gave AQAP a source of funding via taxation and an outlet to the sea through the city&apos;s port.
Despite a yearslong U.S. campaign of covert drone strikes against the group, it has in recent months expanded its control in southern Yemen, taking Al Mukalla and several coastal towns and villages.
It has also continued to coordinate attacks outside Yemen, claiming responsibility for the Jan. 2015 attack on the offices of Paris-based satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people were killed.
Before Sunday&apos;s operation, coalition action against the group had beenmostly limited to fighting in and around the southern port city of Aden, which is controlled by the coalition and coveted by AQAP.
AQAP&apos;s territorial gains also came despite a challenge from Islamic State, which established branches in Yemen in late 2014.
As the campaign against AQAP accelerates, the Houthi rebels and Mr. Hadi&apos;s Saudi-backed government are holding United Nations-mediated peace talks in Kuwait. Several earlier rounds of negotiations failed to produce results.
Yemen&apos;s conflict pits the Saudi-led coalition of mostly Sunni Arab states against the Houthi rebels, who adhere to the Zaidi offshoot of Shiite Islam. The Saudi coalition began its assault last March, seeking to push out the Houthis and restore President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to power.
Saudi Arabia sees the conflict as part of its broader standoff with Iran for power and influence in the Middle East. Shiite-majority Iran supports the Houthis politically, but has denied arming them.
The United Nations estimates that more than 6,200 people have died as a result of the conflict. Millions more have been forced to move from their homes, and the U.N. considers much of the country to be on the brink of famine.

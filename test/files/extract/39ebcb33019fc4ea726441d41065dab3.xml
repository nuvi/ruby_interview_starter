Friday, 4 March 2016 Home Cooking - Chinese / Thai Chicken with dried chillies and herbs Hubby is finally home after ten days away! I missed him whilst he was in China, and was bored of cooking for myself every night. So I was rather rather happy when he said he was cooking over the weekend.He had a dish he liked when he was in Shanghai with a lot of fresh herbs and he wanted to recreate it and make it Thai. It will for sure make a reappearance soon on our dinner table. Read on for more :) The idea is to fry the chicken on a very very high heat after having dropped a huge amount of dried red chilli into a spitting hot pan with some sesame oil. This ensures you end up with chicken that is still tender and jammed full of flavour! He also added spring onions (and will add more onion next time as he felt a bunch of spring onions were insufficient), red peppers and green peppers. He seasoned with fish sauce and soy sauce and then folded in coriander leaves and Thai Basil at the end. Next time he will wait even longer so they are even fresher. It could also work with some additional Szechuan peppercorns or even some peanuts / cashew nuts for some earthiness. Yum! Closer up :) It was good to have some finely sliced green onion parts as well as some larger / longer pieces plus some crunch from the peppers. There was some awesome &apos;wok hei&apos; in there (smokiness from stir frying at a very high heat). No Chinese / Thai meal is complete without some side greens so here we are, oyster sauce and garlic of course. Pretty isn&apos;t it :) Pretty, tasty, healthy. What else could you want? Served with rice from our local Asian shop which is super high quality for just over 2 euros a kilo, cheaper than the bad quality stuff you get at supermarkets and you buy it loose so can control how much you buy. Yay! Do you try to recreate dishes you tasted abroad? Which ones have worked best? at

NEW aerial views of work on the new £34m bypass in North Yorkshire have been revealed. 
These birds eye photos show the new line of the Bedale , Aiskew and Leeming Bar bypass which takes the main A684 into Wensleydale around the town and villages. 
The work is being carried out by Wills Brothers, contractors from County Mayo, who are due to complete the contract several months early in August, for North Yorkshire County Cuncil.

The three mile long road is split approximately halfway by the new line of the A1(M) where there is a realigned roundabout. There are three other roundabouts at either end of the road at Leeming Bar and just outside Bedale near the Golf Club and at Leases Road. The bypass also has two new rail bridges taking it over the Wensleydale railway and Bedale beck. 
Highway bosses say around 14,000 vehicles use the road every day causing congestion particularly through Aiskew and at the corner of the market Place at Bridge Street and Sussex Street. They say the new route will cut traffic flow by up to half as well as improving links with the industrial estate at Leeming. 
Representaives from Wills Bros will be at the Bedale Annual Parish Meeting to give an update on the road on Tuesday 3rd May 2016 at 7pm. The photographs show the road going over the Wensleydale railway and the new roundabout rejoining the A684 outside Bedale.

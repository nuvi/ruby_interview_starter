LONDON--Potential buyers of state-owned oil companies Rosneft and Bashneft are already in discussions with the Russian government, First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov was Quote: d as saying on Monday by the state-owned Tass news agency.
Russia said in January that it was planning on selling shares in the companies, along with bank VTB, mining company Alrosa and shipping company Sovcomflot.
The selling of the companies is to raise much-needed cash for the Russian government. The sale of a 19.5% stake in Rosneft could amount to around 500 billion rubles ($7.5 billion) to 550 billion rubles, according to the Russian government.
Last week, Chinese state-owned China National Petroleum Corp., known as CNPC, said it was interested in buying a stake in Rosneft. The sale of a stake to China would further strengthen energy ties between the two countries, which are becoming closer and closer in their economic relations.
There is already a deal to pipe gas from Russia to China through an approved pipeline--Power of Siberia-2--although the pipeline remains far from fruition.

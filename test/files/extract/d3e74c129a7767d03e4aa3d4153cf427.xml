Do You Know… Enough About Mosquitoes? By: Sandy Dickson 

‘Enough about mosquitoes?’ you ask. 
Yes, like where they breed and like to congregate, and of course, how are they best avoided. 
Where Do They Lay Their Eggs? 
They love standing water; fresh or stagnant water—they aren’t fussy. That can be in anyplace water gathers like tin cans, water troughs, ornamental ponds as well as swimming pools, puddles, ditches, creeks and marshy areas. They can also be in places we might not even suspect, like tipped over lawn chairs that have a bit of water resting in a rim after a rain. So much the better if the area is sheltered from wind by grass and weeds. 
Some mosquito species lay their eggs singly on water surfaces, though some prefer moist dirt. The ones laid on dirt require total drying out first, then when they get wet, they hatch. It could be when land is irrigated, rained upon or even in high tide salt water or a flooded tree hole. One species (called culex, ) lays their eggs singly over a small period of time, but sticks them onto ones they have laid previously. Together, these 100 to 300 stuck-together eggs form what is called a raft , which floats and looks like a piece of soot about 1/4 inch by 1/8 inch wide. 
It takes an egg 24 to 48 hours to hatch into larva, called wigglers, living in water anywhere from 4 to 14 days, depending on the water temperature. They look like tiny caterpillars or worms, and come to the water surface often to get necessary oxygen, which they obtain through tiny tube-like siphons. Some species actually have the ability to puncture vegetation to siphon oxygen out. They float with their heads down and filter anything that can get through the tiny brushes on the side of their mouths, like algae, plankton, fungi and bacteria or any other micro-organisms. Some species are cannibalistic, feeding on the larvae of other mosquito species. The larvae shed their skin four times and grow to about half an inch long. During the larva growing stage, they are called instars. 
The pupa, which is mobile, grows bigger with ech of its four moltings, then emerges. Because it’s lighter than water, it floats on the water’s surface and has two breathing tubes through which it takes in oxygen and needs from one to four days to mature, also depending on water temperature. When this pupal stage is complete, they emerge as adults. Then their wings have to spread out and dry before they can fly. They don’t breed or feed for the first couple days. 
Adult female mosquitoes are the only ones that need blood meals of mammals and birds. They don’t care if their subjects are warm or cold blooded. Blood is protein, and necessary for their egg production. Male mosquitoes only feed on nectar of flowers or other sugar sources. There are also species of females that feed on nectar, but if they drink blood, would prefer that of livestock, small animals or birds rather than human. 
They bite mostly at dusk and after dark. Some mosquitoes are known to transmit diseases. Culex mosquitoes are usually found in the southern U.S., and don’t travel too far from their home, though some have been known to fly up to two miles. The culex’ life span is a few weeks during summer months, but they can hibernate in sheltered places until spring, when they emerge to look for water in which to lay their eggs. The lifespan of other species can last anywhere from four days to one month. 
Tricks Said To Keep Them Away 
Strive for minimal skin exposure and avoid wearing short sleeves and in areas such as mentioned above, or in wooded or shaded areas, especially at both ends of the day when the sun is not bright or in shaded areas. Some people swear that mosquitoes seem to go for people who eat a lot of sugar. Commercial repellents seem to work well, and there are also rubber bracelet-type deterrents available at any pharmaceutical section.. Others have also allowed a dryer sheet to hang out of their pockets, saying it keeps mosquitoes away. Draw an X through a mosquito bite bump with your finger nail to stop the itching. It really works! 2016-04-25

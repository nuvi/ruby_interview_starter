This would make 2016 the most active season since 2012. &quot;Major hurricanes&quot; are those ranked Category 3 or higher.

The United States averages up to two hurricane landfalls a season, according to NOAA statistics shared by the Weather Company. This is just a scientific forecast, of course, and anything could happen over the next seven months.

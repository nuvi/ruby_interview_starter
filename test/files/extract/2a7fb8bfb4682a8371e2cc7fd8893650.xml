Williams Township takes step to oppose pipeline Angry landowners destroy PennEast Pipeline offers APRIL BARTHOLOMEW / MORNING CALL FIle Photo Opponents of the proposed PennEast pipeline protest at Wagner&apos;s Farm in Bethlehem Township in February. Opponents of the proposed PennEast pipeline protest at Wagner&apos;s Farm in Bethlehem Township in February. (APRIL BARTHOLOMEW / MORNING CALL FIle Photo) How Williams Township took an important step against PennEast pipeline 
On April 13, Williams Township Board of Supervisors voted to have the township solicitor draft a resolution opposing the PennEast pipeline. Chairman Mark Ernst requested a vote on behalf of residents who have asked that a resolution be reconsidered. He added that he received a request from Lower Saucon Township asking neighboring municipalities to join in opposing PennEast. 
Supervisor George Washburn stated his opinion supporting the pipeline, arguing that despite federal actions to eliminate fossil fuels there is still a need for natural gas, further opining the resolution as a waste of township money. 
Supervisor Ray Abert, the sole supervisor voting in favor of the resolution last year, countered, &quot;I personally don&apos;t like the pipeline,&quot; offering that the township will not benefit from it. Ernst made a motion, seconded by Abert, that a resolution be drafted by the solicitor, based on detrimental effects to the township and residents. 
This is an important step that many Williams residents have been fighting for since the fall of 2014. A resolution would tell the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and PennEast that this township does not want the pipeline and will not sit passively as it is built. Thank you to Supervisors Ernst and Abert.

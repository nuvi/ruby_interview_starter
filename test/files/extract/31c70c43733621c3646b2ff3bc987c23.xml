Rival high schools raise $11,000 for teacher battling cancer By: Brittany Cooper Posted: Mon 2:49 PM, Apr 25, 2016 By: Brittany Cooper / Headlines List / Article 
BURLEY, Id. ( KMVT / KSVT ) -- Idaho high schools, Burley and Minico are archrivals, but last week, the schools came together for a good cause. 
Band Director Mitch Tilley of Burley is battling cancer and Choir Director Douglas Fisher has been filling in. 
Together, Fisher and Minico Band Director Brett Barker joined forces to throw a Backwards Basketball fundraiser last Thursday. 
The bands played one another, while the athletes took the role of the pep band so-to-speak. 
The school staff at these schools also played one another. 
The goal was to raise $10,000 for Mr. Tilley&apos;s medical costs. 
However, through the event, students and staff were able to raise $8,000 to go towards those medical costs, along with another $3,000 raised during an earlier race. They&apos;ve eclipsed the $11,000 mark. New warning about laundry detergent pods: More children ingesting the pods WILX.com is happy to provide a forum for commenting and discussion.

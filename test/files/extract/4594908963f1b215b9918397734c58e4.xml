The philosophy created by Mauricio Pochettino has given Spurs Champions League potential. Very often, the psychological part of the game is neglected. In this case, the club has really benefited from his novel ideas. No longer is the club associated with collapsing at the crucial end of a season. By maintaining their strong philosophy to accomplish a top four spot, they will undoubtedly prove a force in Europe. 
Pochettino has created a hard work ethic that has surpassed most Premier League teams, which has allowed Spurs to outlast their opponents. He has created a relentless, physically dominant side. The high-pressure system needs such tireless work, or it gets exploited. When it succeeds, the relentless pressure allows the team to begin to dominate in matches. In Europe, there are many teams that employ similar hardworking philosophies, such as Luis Enrique’s Barcelona. The biggest challenge for Spurs will be playing these sorts of teams, who are just as fit and are superior in terms of technical ability. Although many teams are incredibly comfortable under high pressure, sitting back is not the solution. Instead, a more conservative version of the philosophy must be employed. There is a lot of room for the clubs philosophy to grow and evolve still further. 
A never say die attitude has been instilled into every squad member. This means that despite any scoreline, the players fight to come back, hold or even increase a lead. In the past, this has been one of the clubs major problems, lacking the drive and the motivation to give all to every game. Now the fans almost expect a last minute winner. This has given Spurs Champions League potential because the club will be matched up against teams that are equal or above them in terms of quality. As a result, every minute of each match will be a constant struggle for dominance. Against the giants of Europe, there may a deficit that needs to be recovered. Suddenly, the players might be fighting for a desperate draw. For a successful return to Europe, this unceasing desire to put everything into every match to get a result is important. 
The squad has a great sense of togetherness. Many fans will chuckle at the affections shared by Dele Alli and Eric Dier, but such bonds are crucial. When players start to form friendships, it begins to create a squad that is prepared to fight for each other. No longer is Spurs just a collection of mercenaries. There is a clear show of passion amongst teammates. Again, Europe will prove to be a massive test for the players. Pooling together will give them the best chance of success. It is so important that the squad retain this togetherness, as it pushes each player to their full potential. The positive fear of letting teammates down ensures that every sinew is stretched, thus making up for any one player’s lack of technical ability in comparison to the European giants. 
Spurs Champions League title hopes aren’t as distant as they once were, as a result of this all important philosophy. There is still a lot of work to do, yet Pochettino is building the foundations for success.

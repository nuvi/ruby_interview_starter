Director keen to make ‘Princess Diaries 3’   
LOS ANGELES, Apr 25: “Princess Diaries” director Garry Marshall has revealed that he has spoken to its star Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews for another sequel of the franchise. The director said Disney is yet to move ahead but they have already met and discussed the possibility, Marshall told Larry King.“Well, they talk about it. Disney always likes to announce things, so they tell Garry, ‘Shut up, we’ll announce it&apos;” he joked on the show.“(Anne Hathaway) came to my office, she was quite pregnant… She puts her computer on the table, pushes three buttons, there’s Julie Andrews on Skype in Long Island. And we have a meeting.”“This is how we work. So I hope they do it.” The first film featured an awkward teenager who finds out that she is the heir to a throne while the second movie saw her as a royal in the middle of an arranged marriage. Actor Chris Pine, who played Hathaway’s love interest in the sequel, has already expressed a desire to be part of the third movie, if it is ever made. (PTI) Share this:

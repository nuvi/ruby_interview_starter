THOUSANDS of people were briefly left without electricity after a power cut hit Stourbridge just after 5.30pm. 
Western Power Distribution said 3,800 customers were initially affected after a circuit tripped out at the Lye sub station at 5.39pm. 
Dave Satchwell, shift manager for WPD, told the News shortly after 6pm that 365 customers in Timmis Road, Rufford Road and Castle Gardens were still affected but he stressed power would be restored by 7pm. 
He said: &quot;They&apos;ll be back on within the hour.&quot; 
We are aware of a #powercut in the #Stourbridge #Hagley #DY8 #DY9 and surrounding area. We aim to restore all supplies by 19:00. Andi.

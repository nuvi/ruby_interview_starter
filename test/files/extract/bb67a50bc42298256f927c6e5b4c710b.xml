Join Meetup friends on Wednesday evening for a relaxed, beginner hike on the beautiful Aliso Creek Trail. We stop midway for the pasta dinner special at Cook&apos;s Corner.
ABOUT THE HIKE: The 2.3 mile gentle upslope (400 feet elevation gain) route to Cook&apos;s is a paved bike trail with National Recreation Trail designation having lovely views of the Aliso Creek wet lands. We will stop at Cook&apos;s Corner for the weekly all you can eat, four buck, pasta/salad/toast dinner special... dining in an informal, outdoor, picnic setting. As a country/rock band is usually playing at Cook&apos;s, we have been known to take over the dance floor! Following the one hour of dinner and dancing, we will return downhill the same 2.3 miles on the Aliso Creek trail to the parking area. The hike usually arrives back at the trailhead around 9 PM. This is a relatively safe, easy paced, scenic, beginner hike.... and a fun and relaxing way to get some exercise and socialize with Meetup friends.
ADDITIONAL NOTES: Restrooms are available at Cook&apos;s, but not at the trailhead. Evenings can be cool on the patio, so please bring a warm jacket. As we will be hiking in the dark on a paved trail, a flash light is recommended.
 Freeway, take El Toro Road inland, approximately one half mile beyond the Santa Margarita Parkway/Portola Parkway/El Toro Road intersection. The safest access to the single lane driveway leading to the trail side parking area is west bound on El Toro Road. If you are headed east on El Toro and come to Marguerite Parkway, you have missed the driveway. Turn left into the Church parking lot and circle back heading west on El Toro. Again, the driveway access to the trail side parking is approximately 100 yards west of the Marguerite Parkway/Saddleback Church entrance/El Toro Road intersection. The driveway into the Meetup location is unmarked (look for the 55 MPH sign) and single lane. Please use extreme caution making the turn into our trail side parking area. Please arrive ten minutes early to provide time for a brief orientation and introductions.

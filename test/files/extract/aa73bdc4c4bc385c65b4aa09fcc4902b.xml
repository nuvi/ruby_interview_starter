The Division server maintenance won&apos;t occur today 25 News Ubisoft has announced server maintenance periods for The Division will be changing. 
Ubisoft has announced the weekly maintenance period for Tom Clancy’s The Division will now take place on Thursday mornings, instead of Tuesdays, although it’ll still be taking place at the same time. 
In a message sent out today, Ubisoft revealed The Division’s maintenance day will be changing. Here’s the official statement: 
Please note that Weekly Maintenance will now take place on Thursdays instead of Tuesdays (same time). There will be no maintenance tomorrow. — The Division (@TheDivisionGame) April 25, 2016 
That means Agents should now expect The Division’s servers to go down for maintenance on Thursdays, which for this week, means April 28th is server maintenance day. The time the server maintenance period begins won’t be changing, so you shouldn’t expect to play The Division starting at 12:00am PT / 3:00am ET on that day. Daniel Perez Senior Editor

Associated Press ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - A new report says 52,000 children in New Mexico have had a parent serve time behind bars at some point in their lives.
The Annie E. Casey Foundation report released Monday shows New Mexico is one of a six states where 10 percent of youth have a parent who has been incarcerated.
Only Kentucky and Indiana had higher rates. The national rate is 7 percent.
The non-profit New Mexico Voices for Children says the report underscores the need for reforms that could include directing judges to consider the impact a sentence could have on a defendant&apos;s child, and measures aimed easing a parent&apos;s reentry into society after prison.
State Department of Corrections figures show there are currently more than 7,000 inmates in the state&apos;s prison system.

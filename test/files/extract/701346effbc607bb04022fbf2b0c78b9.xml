Thanks to 3D Technology, You Can Now Buy Your Very Own Wind Waker Posted on April 25 2016 by Molly Maugans 
Let&apos;s be real, Zelda has some impressive items, like the Wind Waker. A wand that can control the wind would be awesome. Think about all the chaos you could create, think about the corruption you could cause in the weather, think about all the hairstyles you could wear and not have to worry about the wind messing them up! But sadly, you can&apos;t actually pull the Wind Waker from the screen, it&apos;s just a game. Or, can you? Ladies and gentleman, I present to you: the future. 
You can now buy your own personal, life size Wind Waker from 3DCreationsPR on Etsy. Magical powers not included, of course. But, this 3D printed replica looks just like the Wind Waker from the game and will make that Toon Link cosplay you&apos;ve been dying to do look even better. Or, you could just by it because it&apos;s really cool and would look great sitting on the shelf of a collector. You can also choose to buy the Wind Waker in a different color, including a glow in the dark green and a color changing purple that turns to pink! That&apos;s almost like magic. Starting at $15.00 USD, (not including shipping) you can by your own Wind Waker here. Take a few minutes to look at the other awesome 3D Printed replicas offered by 3DCreationsPR. 
Are you planning on buying one? What color do you like the best? Let us know in the comments below!

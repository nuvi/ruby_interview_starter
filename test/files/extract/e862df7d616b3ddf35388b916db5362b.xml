Deputies suspect woman immersed 7-year-old&apos;s foot in scalding wa - WDAM-TV 7-News, Weather, Sports-Hattiesburg, MS Member Center: Deputies suspect woman immersed 7-year-old&apos;s foot in scalding water 2016-04-23T18:24:55Z 55-year-old Jaqueline Raysor is facing a charge of unlawful conduct toward a child after she took her 7-year-old granddaughter to the hospital Thursday night. (SOURCE: SCSO) SUMTER COUNTY, SC (WIS) - 
A woman who just relocated to Sumter is facing a charge of unlawful conduct toward a child after she took her 7-year-old granddaughter to the hospital Thursday night, according to Sumter County authorities. 
Investigators say 55-year-old Jaqueline Raysor and two children, a 7-year-old girl and a 9-year-old boy, moved to Sumter on Tuesday from Louisiana. 
On Thursday night, investigators say Raysor showed up in an emergency room in Kershaw County with the 7-year-old girl who was suffering from a severe burn to her foot. Investigators described the injury as an &quot;immersive burn&quot; suspected to be from the girl&apos;s foot immersed in scalding water. The girl also showed signs of having been beaten with various bruises and other marks on her body, according to authorities. 
The hospital notified Kershaw authorities when they suspected child abuse, who then notified the Sumter County Sheriff’s Office. 
Investigators say the little girl was taken into emergency protective care, and was transferred to a different area hospital for treatment of severe injuries. The child is listed in &quot;guarded condition&quot; and hospital staff are working hard to save her foot. The girl&apos;s 9-year-old brother was also taken into protective custody.

Investigators say Raysor claims to be the children’s grandmother and that her daughter, the children’s mother, is dead. Authorities say she moved to Sumter to reconnect with the children’s grandfather. 
Sumter authorities say they had grounds to charge her because she admitted to moving to Sumter on Tuesday, but she did not seek medical treatment for the child until Thursday night. Investigators say medical personnel determined the child’s injury happened before Tuesday. 
Investigators are working with Louisiana authorities to validate Raysor’s claims and to see if there are any reports of child abuse involving her there. 
Investigators say charges could be upgraded if the child’s injuries prove to be more severe than first indicated and other charges could also be forthcoming.

Man denies murder near York pub Leeds Crown Court. Share: 
THE man accused of killing another man near a York pub has denied a charge of murder. 
Kenneth Dunnington, 58, of Byland Avenue, north York, appeared before Leeds Crown Court for a plea and trial preparation hearing via video link from Armley Jail in Leeds. 
He spoke briefly during the 20-minute hearing to confirm his name and to enter a “not guilty” plea to the charge of murdering Benjamin Traherne, 45, of Bad Bargain Lane, east York, on March 7, near the city&apos;s Fulford Arms pub.

He is likely to stand trial at Leeds in July, though no date was set. The Recorder of Leeds, Judge Peter Collier QC, said it would be before September 21 because Dunnington is currently in custody. 
He heard that the trial is likely to last six or seven days and said its date will be decided soon. 
The judge made orders for the prosecution and defence lawyers to carry out so that the case will be ready for trial by June 30, and remanded Dunnington in custody. Share:

FIR against BJP&apos;s Roopa Ganguly for assaulting TMC activist 25 Apr 2016, 2314 hrs IST , AGENCIES An FIR was today lodged against BJP leader Roopa Ganguly for allegedly assaulting a woman Trinamool Congress activist and also &quot;obstructing&quot; her from casting her vote at a poll booth in Howrah. TV cameras showed Ganguly pushing the hand of Soma Das outside the poll booth after a heated altercation. In her police complaint, Das alleged she was assaulted by the BJP leader when she went along with her mother to cast their votes. She also complained that Ganguly told her not to cast her vote. Ganguly, the actress-turned-politician, is the BJP candidate from Howrah North seat. She has denied the allegations claiming it was the Trinamool workers who pushed her. Additional Director General of Police (law and order) Anuj Sharma said the matter was under investigation. &quot;She (Roopa) was trying to create trouble here. There are no issues in our constituency as it is a very peaceful place. You can&apos;t push voters like that. This is not right,&quot; cricketer Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who is fighting from the seat on a Trinamool ticket, said. The TMC has also filed a complaint against Ganguly with the Election Commission. &quot;I have been getting complaints from various booths. When I went to do a ground reality check, Trinamool goons pushed me. They are goons and they are levelling false allegations against me,&quot; Ganguly said. As TV cameras tracked her every move, she was seen entering many booths, talking to voters and even got involved in arguments with polling personnel. During her visit to booths, she faced protest from TMC workers who asked her to leave the place and not create any trouble. Ganguly alleged that Trinamool workers were jamming booths in many places and intimidating voters. At Salkia, she even alleged that the presiding officer was &quot;drunk&quot;. &quot;He is drowsy and drunk. How can he be allowed to operate like this?&quot; Ganguly was seen asking an observer.

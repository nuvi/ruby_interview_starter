I always advise beginning and even seasoned screenwriters to find a mentor to help guide and inspire them. 
My mentor was the late, great writer/director Wes Craven. He showed me how to write more visually and how to “milk” great moments on film. He taught me that the narrative or description was as important as the dialogue and helped me figure out what to include in a screenplay and what to hide — such as subtext – what the characters are feeling but not saying. 
The screenwriter I most admire today is Tony Gilroy. He wrote the Bourne movies, wrote and directed Michael Clayton , Dolores Claiborne and many others. 
He spends so much time and effort constructing his narrative description . Every word is there for a reason and when you read a Tony Gilroy script you are literally “seeing” the movie unfold before you. And even though Gilroy directs most of his screenplays, he spends an inordinate amount of time being as precise and lyrical with his narrative as possible, almost like a Japanese haiku. 
As screenwriters, we can learn so much by deconstructing exactly what he’s doing on the page to create the startling effect his screenplays have on the reader. 
If you’ve ever had problems writing action sequences, formatting your screenplay so it has the greatest impact on your readers, had questions about introducing your main characters as succinctly as possible or wondered about where to start scenes or where to end them – you can’t do better than sitting at the knee of this great screenwriter and learning his secrets. 
This is what we’ll do when we take the first 10 pages of The Bourne Identity and really tear apart what this great screenwriter is doing and how we can learn from his craft. We’ll also look at the introduction of Michael Clayton and how the screenwriter makes his protagonist as riveting as possible from the moment we first meet him. Even though this protagonist is very flawed, we still root for him. How is that accomplished?

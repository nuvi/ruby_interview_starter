Five year plan launch next week The scene during the event which saw the projects chosen. 0 comments 
KELTY residents have been invited to turn out in force for the official launch of the area’s Five-Year Community Action Plan, which includes proposals to take over and run the Moray Institute for the benefit of local people. 
The Action Plan was produced as part of The Coalfields Regeneration Trust’s Coalfields Community Futures programme with the CRT providing a participatory budget of £20,000, with Fife Council topping that up with another £10,000 to get priority projects up and running. 
The launch event will be held on Friday April 28 from 6.30pm-8pm when local people will be able to read the plan for the first time, and meet some of the local groups who received funding. 
Claire Campbell, a member of the local Steering Group said: “We have already had tremendous support from the local community with over 260 turning out to vote for the plans and projects that they wanted to be given priority in the Action Plan. 
“Now they have their first chance to get their hands on the Community Action Plan and we hope as many people as possible will join us to give it a really rousing send-off.” 
One of the biggest talking points to emerge from the Action Plan is the proposal to set up a Development Trust to manage and potentially take over the Moray Institute to run a host of events and activities including: a community café, themed evenings, an indoor market, and a drop-in centre. 
The plans for the Moray Institute are in addition to a commitment to make Kelty’s new Community Centre a success. 
Other proposals include a feasibility study into a bike trail in Blairadam Forrest, and heritage trails around the village, setting up a litter pick weekend and creating a Kelty Garden Prize Award for local residents and an annual Community Award for local businesses. 
Among the local organisations who won funding from the CRT’s participatory Budget were: The primary school PTA who received £2,000 for playground equipment, Kelty Bowling Club who received £7,600 for an extension project, the 77th Scout Group who received £3,500 for disabled toilets and access, and the Scottish Coal Carrying Championships who received £4,600, as well as several local bands, heritage and playgroups and the local Credit Union. 
Bob Young Scottish Trustee of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust said: “Our Coalfields Community Futures Programme has helped Kelty express its strong sense community in a really positive way, and I am sure they will turn out in force to give the Action plan the launch it deserves”. Share:

The City of Greensboro&apos;s Gillespie Golf Course is celebrating its 75th anniversary this summer and is starting its summer-long celebration Monday, April 25 with a one-day promotion of 75-cent green fees. Tee times are encouraged, but not required. The course is open from 8 am until sunset. Gillespie Golf Course opened in 1941 as a nine-hole course on 80 acres of rolling hill-country located a short distance from the center of the city. In 1991, major alterations produced an additional set of tees, which now provides an opportunity to play the course as an 18-hole course. The 75-cent green fee does not include use of a cart, which is $6 for 9 holes and $10 for 18 holes. Gillespie Golf Course is located at 306 E. Florida St. To make a tee time or for more information, contact the Gillespie Golf Course club house at 336-373-5850.

Beyoncé’s sixth studio album (second visual album) and art film, Lemonade , is a study in transforming turmoil into material for art. Not unlike everything else Queen Bey touches on, it features meticulously detailed costumes, political standpoints, ace collaborations and a release strategy that had people tracing every mention of lemons. The music, however, is raw, gut-wrenching and honest to the point that it leaves no speculation about the artist’s otherwise-private life. 
The album features a video of Jay Z’s grandmother Hattie White on her 90th birthday, in which she says, “I was given lemons and I made lemonade”, which seems to have inspired the title of the album. The artist, notorious for barely permitting one-on-one interviews, finally spoke out about cheating (with fired up speculations about her marriage), her parent’s broken marriage and wider issues of racism, finally coming full circle to reconciliation and forgiveness. 
Everything Beyoncé does is supersized—the release of single ‘Formation’, two Superbowl performances, the surprise release of her fifth studio album Beyoncé , which cemented the artist as the feminist pop icon of the moment. But her new work is an eye-opener, challenging the curious to take a real look at her personal life. 
As with all celebrity couples who try to avoid publicity, the effect is quite the reverse. However, Jay Z and Beyoncé give out as much information as they think is right. In her autobiographical film Life Is But A Dream she gives a powerful performance of the ballad ‘Resentment’, which she also performed at her ‘I am… Yours’ and ‘Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live in Atlantic city’ shows. The song, which was originally performed by Victoria Beckham, traces infidelity in a relationship. The infamous TMZ footage of Solange’s fued with Jay Z was the first publicly visible chip in Beyoncé and Jay Z’s marriage. A few months down the line, the singer rapped about the incident, leaving no room for rumours about what goes on in the Carter-Knowles household. 
Her latest album is not for those naive enough to believe in celebrity happily ever afters. “Can’t you see there’s no other man above you? / What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you,” she sings in the track ‘Hold Up’. And “You can taste the dishonesty / It’s all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier,” in the opening track ‘Pray You Catch Me’. 
Beyoncé’s firing of her father and manager Matthew Knowles is public knowledge. Not only was he instrumental in shaping her career but he was also the one man who approval she constantly sought, whose infidelity destroyed her parent’s marriage. In ‘Daddy Issues’, she sings not only of her own troubles with her father but also her partner’s, “Go ahead and cry little boy you know that your daddy did too /You know what your mama went through,” reminding her lover that the history they tried to get past would repeat itself. Jay Z comes in towards the end of the album: “I’ll trade your broken wings for mine / Trade your broken wings for mine/ I’ve seen your scars and kissed your crime…,” in ‘All Night’. 
Lemonade is not Sasha Fierce stomping in Alexander McQueen, it is not her dancing in Staten Island searching through the crowds for the face for her lover and it is certainly not her asking the driver to roll down the partition. Lemonade is mature in nature, not because of explicit lyrics, but because the pain of a grown woman—whose perfect life is a reference point of empowerment to young fans—rings loud. It is mature because she owns a difficult aspect of her life and heals her broken self in the only way she finds release—by singing about it. In her journey that follows the Kübler-Ross model of grief, Beyoncé emerges at acceptance, stronger than before. 
Perfection, according to Beyoncé is a disease of a nation. Lemonade is her evolution from the image she’s long lived in. And while the album strikes low on the party anthem scale, its resonance with anyone who may have gone through similar times will see it as one of the strongest bodies of music to emerge this year. It traces the complexities of marriage and human nature and the higher power of letting go. The art film was released on HBO, and the album is now available on Tidal (the streaming service owned by Jay Z) and will soon be released on iTunes. 
Each of the highly-stylised videos feature the artist in her signature over-the-top flair. Vogue India’s senior fashion editor, Priyanka Kapadia, decodes the looks from Lemonade : 1 /10

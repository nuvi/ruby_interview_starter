Master the Kitchen with 5 Cooking Secrets from HelloFresh! Become a master chef with kitchen secrets from HelloFresh, plus three easy recipes to get you started! Comment   By HelloFresh   Did you know that less than 60% of American dinners that were served at home in 2015 were actually home-cooked? That&apos;s down from 75% just 30 years ago. The struggle to get dinner on the table is real. Meal-kit delivery service HelloFresh makes it easier by doing the planning and shopping for you, making cooking fun and hassle-free. Here are 5 kitchen secrets from HelloFresh chef Freida Hirsch , a member of the team who creates 500+ recipes annually, all designed to be repeated by millions of novice at-home cooks.

To poach an egg , the trick is to create a whirlpool! Once the water is simmering, add a tablespoon or two of white vinegar and swirl. Pour the egg into the center and cook 2-3 minutes while continuing the whirlpool. When chopping vegetables , practice makes perfect! The tip is to shape your hand into a claw to make your fingertips perpendicular to the food to stabilize and shield your fingertips from the knife. To prepare fish , add the heat! The key to preventing the fish from sticking is a very hot pan with a drizzle of a neutral oil.

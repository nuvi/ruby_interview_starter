Risk Taking 
Horse Thief Mountain Bike Trail overlooking the Colorado River in Fruita, CO 
It was an open heart surgery anniversary trip that I returned from yesterday afternoon. From the moment a good friend moved me from being a casual mountain biker to a more serious mountain biker several years ago, I’ve always wanted to ride in Fruita, CO where some of the best mountain biking on the planet can be found. 
Over the weekend, two friends joined me to help me accomplish this goal. The photo above is just one frame of the 20 or so miles we rode over the weekend. In Fruita, whether you’re riding on the easiest trails or the most difficult trails or something in-between, you’re doing something that most people don&apos;t do in order to reap rewards that most people will never experience. 
For my two buddies, this was a quick weekend road trip. For me, this trip represented reaching a goal I set a while back. For someone who hasn’t had open heart surgery, navigating the trails of Fruita is quite difficult. For someone who has had open heart surgery, navigating the trails of Fruita is a huge mental and physical challenge. 
I occasionally post other people’s quotes. I post other people’s quotes because I take their quotes seriously. Last week I shared this quote from Jim Rohn. “IF YOU ARE UNWILLING TO RISK THE UNUSUAL, YOU WILL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR THE ORDINARY” 
I risked the unusual and my reward was anything but ordinary. What is it that you might need to risk in order to experience something other than ordinary? 
In case you’re wondering if I wrecked over 20 miles of riding on rocks, the answer is yes. Yesterday morning my front tire got stuck between two rocks and I proceeded to fly over the handlebars. I landed on my chest and my chin on nothing but rock. The rock won that battle. 
It hurts but I’ll get over it. The puck drops soon for my next hockey game on Thursday and I have to start preparing for our next weekend mountain bike road trip to Wyoming!

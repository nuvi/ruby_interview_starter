This picture of Sridevi and daughter Jhanvi Kapoor is something you can&apos;t miss today IndiaToday.in New Delhi, Monday, April 25, 2016 Sridevi with her daughter Jhanvi Kapoor Text resize A A 
Sridevi and her daughter Jhanvi Kapoor are off to an undisclosed location for a vacation. Sridevi took to Instagram to share a picture of the two. 
A photo posted by Sridevi Kapoor (@sridevi.kapoor) on Apr 24, 2016 at 9:18pm PDT 

In the picture, Sridevi and her daughter are posing for a camera and in the background you can notice snow-capped mountains. There is no doubt that the two are looking stunning in the picture. 
Earlier, there were rumours that Jhanvi Kapoor might make her Bollywood debut with Student of the Year 2. And ever since Jhanvi has expressed her desire to become an actor, she has been flooded with film projects. 
But Sridevi, who left her career for her daughters, wants them to focus on their studies first and then think about their career. In an interview, the Puli had said, &quot;I want both my daughters to get a good education. I missed out on it as I was working from a very early age. I was good at studies, but because I became busy with films, I couldn&apos;t complete my education.&quot; 
On the work front, Sridevi made a comeback in Bollywood in 2012 with R Balki&apos;s film English Vinglish.

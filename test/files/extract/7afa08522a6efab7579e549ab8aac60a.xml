For six years, John Harris and John Domokos have travelled the UK to get a sense of British politics away from the Westminster bubble. Meanwhile, old-fashioned two-party politics has crumbled amid a rising sense of discontent with the status quo.

The good thing about Corbyn is that he is a real, genuine voice of the Labour left. It is as important a voice to listen to as the tory right &amp; UKIP are in England and the SNP in Scotland.
Labour especially has lost its way in Scotland. May 5th will potentially see Labour come 3rd in Scotland, a result not seen since 1918. Getting to the bottom of that - and why the Tories may beat Labour into 3rd in Scotland is vital to understanding deep-seated rot in the Labour Party.
I&apos;ve recently stopped commenting on \&quot;The Scotsman\&quot; website as there were very sinister efforts to reveal my identity by a small group of Tory comments writers, or possibly just one obsessed person. They seemed to work out who I was either from me clicking a link to their own website, or altogether more sinister means - and they started to tell people the letter that my surname begins with. Either way, I don&apos;t want to put my family through some troll/media ordeal (I&apos;m not famous, wealthy or any kind of public figure, just a regular Joe, like you, dear reader, with an opinion).
What is happening in Scotland is just beyond bonkers, but worth a look to understand why.

Share Photo ✉ ⎙ San Diego  As part of bringing the All-Star Game to San Diego this July, Major League Baseball will contribute more than $1.5 million to community projects and sports fields in Tijuana, Escondido and Southeastern San Diego. League officials and the Padres announced on Monday the list of planned “legacy” projects, which have become an annual tradition in host cities for the All-Star Game. They include the first international legacy project, upgrading a basketball court south of the border into a 16,000-square-foot recreation area featuring a field for kick ball and Wiffle ball. In addition, Club de Ninos and Ninas de Mexico will get a pitching machine, upgraded batting cages and other renovations. Opened in 2008, the club serves 750 low-income children on a typical day. The league will also contribute to its first softball-specific legacy project by upgrading the softball field at Escondido’s San Pasqual Academy, a school for foster teens. Also in Escondido, a parking lot will be transformed into a multi-purpose baseball diamond with a manual scoreboard and moveable fences at the Mitchell branch of the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Greater San Diego. In Southeastern San Diego, the league will contribute to the complete rebuild of the Jackie Robinson Family YMCA, including softball and baseball fields for youth. In Barrio Logan, the league will assist Monarch School in developing a 7,000-square-foot career academy focused on growing job sectors in the local economy. Finally, the league will help military veterans adjust to civilian life with a program focused on resume writing and other employment assistance. The contributions come from revenue that will be generated by All-Star Workout Day, which includes the annual Home Run Derby on July 11. That will be followed one day later by the All-Star Game on July 12, which will culminate a wide variety of lead-up festivities beginning July 8. San Diego has hosted the All-Star Game twice before, in 1978 and 1992, but not since the Padres moved to Petco Park in 2004. The city agreed last year to cover up to $1.5 million for police officers, firefighters and other services during the event. City Council members said hosting the world’s best baseball players would boost the city’s economy and enhance its image, while also allowing residents to attend the game or participate in the related activities. A city analysis said hosting the All-Star Game would generate $1 million in sales tax, $1.2 million in transient-occupancy taxes at hotels, up to $2 million for local charities and about $80 million in overall economic activity for San Diego. That would include 60,000 tourists, worldwide TV exposure and a surge in customers at attractions like the San Diego Zoo and many other local businesses during the five days.

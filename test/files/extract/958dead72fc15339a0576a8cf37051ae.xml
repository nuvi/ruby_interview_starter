toxic thoughts 
Taking care of relationships may seem like a troublesome job, but it isn’t quite true if you really think about it. You are in a relationship with the one you love, you have always dreamed of this. Then what is it, really, that is causing you to think negative thoughts? The answer is unnecessary worries. 
Below are a few of the toxic thoughts of people that end up ruining the relationship, and which are what you should be eliminating from your thought process. 1. T he Problem Is Something Else 
Not accepting the truth can be the beginning of a problem. Try to evaluate what is going wrong in the relation that you are in, what is the source of the problems and then try to figure out how the problem can be sorted out. 2. I Will Be Happy When… 
People dream of the future quite often. Picture how things can be, and how they would like it to be. But many a times we get swayed by our expectations and connect them to our happiness. This leads to unhappiness, if at all anything. 
Instead of thinking about what changes in your life will make you happy, focus on what you have now that is above your expectations of the past that makes you happy. Try to move past the materialistic happiness and look at the small things that make you happy. 
Do something for others, take care of children or older people, donate to a charity- not money but your precious time-, spend some time with your partner etc. There is a lot you can do to be happy. You only need to look in the right places. 3. What Do People Think? 
Answer this to yourself: will you really let people’s opinions determine your relationship? People will think lots of things, but it should not matter to you because what they see will always be different from what you see. 
Some people constantly worry about what will their significant other’s friends or family members think of them. This often leads to disruption of good relationships. The reason is one of the partner’s low self esteem. 
In order to have a peaceful life you need to stop worrying about how other people see you. Those people that matter to you, in very true terms, know who you are and accept you just the way you are. 4. Either I’m Not Good Enough For My Partner” or “My Partner Is Not Good Enough For Me” 
I’m not good enough for my partner: This again leads back to the ‘self-esteem’ issue. The only person for whom you should change yourself is yourself. If you are happy with your personality, your habits and lifestyle, then that is enough to make yourself happy. And your happiness leads to the happiness of you and your partner. 
In order to make yourself feel equal to your significant other, you need to be content. Fill the lacunas, improve which can be improved and accept the things that are unchangeable. These are some of the ways you can help yourself be happy in the long run. Also, a self-loving and confident person is always more attractive to people than self-hating personalities. Love yourself and you will realize your true worth. 
My partner is not good enough for me: Sometimes on the lookout for being self-loving and confident, one might slip into the zone of ‘egoism’. This ‘ego’ makes people think wrong things like how they deserve more than they have, how others are lesser than them and so on. Though we do agree that humans are creatures who are always looking for more, it is not right to judge your partner based on your expectations, desires and abilities. Everyone is unique and they are perfect in their own ways. 
We should not try to change everyone according to the view that we have of the world. In order to eliminate these thoughts you can learn to accept the flaws as well as the strengths of your partner. Work together with your partner to eradicate these toxic thinking. What matters most in any relation is that you love and accept each other the way you are. A happy relation is built on compatibility, respect and, of course, love. 5. It’s Not My Fault 
We often blame others for our faults. It started with the smaller things like, “you forgot to bring the cereal’ to ‘my life is ruined only because of you!”. It does give us a sense of relief for a split second because the guilt is uplifted, but we know deep down inside that we are to blame. Constantly blaming the others often ruins the relation. 
Instead of trying to run away from your mistakes, try to accept them. Making mistakes is not a big problem, but not accepting your mistakes is. When you decide to change this habit of blaming others, instead of feeling dependent, you will feel empowered. Take responsibility of yourself and see how much better it makes you feel. You will not be afraid of making more mistakes, in turn, making you more confident. 6. I Am Always Right 
Psychologists say that people who assert to always being right are people who have an underlying fear of something. This fear could be of anything. Whether small or big, suppressing a fear will only make the fear grow. This could lead to other negative thoughts like ‘My partner might cheat on me’ or ‘My partner doesn’t love me anymore’. The first step to eliminate these thoughts is to acknowledge what your underlying fear is. Once you know, you might want to find ways to deal with it. Take help from a psychiatrist. They will show you the way out of your problem. 7. I Deserve More 
When we agree to the fact that feeling entitled to a better life is only normal for almost everyone, we do not, certainly, agree that it is the right thing to do. It is becoming quite a complex situation: you have a wonderful partner who loves you but you feel you are entitles to all his time and affection. 
If you have been given something wonderful, cherish it but don’t feel ‘entitled’ to anything. You can pay back the love that you receive, but don’t take advantage of the people. Cherish the things that you have and you will be happier. 8. I Hate It When They Do That 
Hating or disliking a habit of someone is not that big a deal. It starts to become a problem when you either don’t express you hatred at all or you express it too much. 
When you express you hatred too much your relation will be sour and that is quite obvious. Small things like forgetting to buy something from the grocery list, not keeping the car keys in the right place or not calling back are things which can be changed or accepted. You should remember that everyone makes mistakes and forgetting something is only natural. So, figure out how to deal with such things, instead of blaming them. 
When you don’t express your dislike towards something and keep it inside, the hatred grows and grows and erupts like a volcano, later. Try to talk it out with your partner and find a solution. Your relationship started with you both being comfortable with each other. So, you should feel comfortable enough to speak out whatever it is that is bothering you. 9. I Will Give Everything I have To See Them Happy 
We all want to see our loved ones happy , but it should be the same for them too. If not, then what’s the point in making all the efforts to get nothing in return, not even appreciation? In a relationship, it the efforts shouwl come from both the sides. 
While it is only usual to want to make them happy, the same thought should also come from them. Most important of all is to see that you are not loosing yourself in the way. What you can do is see if the same effort is being made from the opposite direction. Else, there are some cracks you need to mend. Other Interesting Posts:

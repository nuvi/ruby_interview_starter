Hamilton’s Lin-Manuel Miranda Raps Impassioned Plea to Congress for Help for Struggling Puerto Rico April 25, 2016 
0 comments YouTube / Screenshot 
As Puerto Rico continues to struggle with a $70 billion debt crisis, Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, the son of Puerto Ricans, appeared on Sunday’s episode of John Oliver’s Last Week Tonight. 
Miranda rapped about Puerto Rico’s problems in a plea to Congress for help. 
Some of the lyrics included: 
Yeah, my family’s from Puerto Rico, the tropical destination where you can spend your Washingtons the spot where you vacation. 
A commonwealth with not a lot of wealth and not quite nation, $70 billion topic of conversation. 
Hoping to God John Oliver’s comical dissertation resonates with the Congress that got us in this situation, along with suicidal tax incentive declarations. 
Yeah, we’ll pay your bonds first, close the hospitals, fuck the patients. 
This is an island, 100 miles across, a hurricane is coming, and we’re running up a loss. 
So how bad is Puerto Rico? Well, it’s not all sunshine down there. In fact, the territory is dealing with a crippling poverty rate of 45 percent. A large portion of Puerto Rico’s problems can also be traced back to the fact that the territory isn’t classified as a technical state. In the past when it benefited from manufacturing jobs and tax credits, the economy flourished, but when Congress decided to remove those benefits, the downward spiral begun. 
As the debt grew, Puerto Rico found itself unable to pay off debt from bonds. However, because it isn’t a state, it found itself unable to declare Chapter 9 bankruptcy. 
“Which is huge,” Oliver explained. “If you are massively in debt, and you can’t declare bankruptcy, you are stuck. And this happened because of a tiny amendment to a law in 1984. And the crazy thing is no one can say why it was written.” 
The last point by Oliver is completely true. There is no documented reason why the law was changed. 
To make matters worse, the Zika virus is expected to decimate the island and the government is ill-prepared to deal with a massive outbreak. 
The only hope for Puerto Rico is the compassion of Congress. Sadly, like so many other bills, the bill has stalled and appears to have no hope of passing. Also on Latest.com

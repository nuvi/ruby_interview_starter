Updated: April 26, 2016 00:02 IST Cruz, Kasich in ‘stop Trump’ deal election To cede States to the stronger of the two in some forthcoming contests Republican rivals in the presidential nomination race Ted Cruz and John Kasich have buried the hatchet to target a common enemy – front runner Donald Trump. Both campaigns have announced that they would cede states to the stronger of the two in some of the forthcoming contests. As per the agreement announced, Mr Kasich will concede Indiana to Mr Cruz who in turn will concede Oregon and New Mexico to the former, in primaries in May and June. The Cruz-Kasich coalition is a last-minute effort to stop Mr Trump from winning 1237 bound delegates before the party convention, and potentially the most consequential of all anti-Trump moves so far. If Mr Trump does not win the nomination in the first ballot, delegates are then free to vote as they please. Anti-Trump forces hope to discard him through such a second ballet. This was a path pushed by the 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, but is also fraught with serious risks. For one, this will force sharper polarisation, forcing some supporters of Mr Kasich and Mr Cruz to consider Mr Trump, who could win a majority ahead of the convention. Mr Trump’s response to the move indicated his forthcoming campaign pitch. “Lyin&apos; Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors &amp; special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad,” the front runner tweeted. Mr Cruz and Mr Kasich represent the extreme poles within the Republican spectrum. As senator and otherwise, Mr Cruz has been a proponent of absolute rollback of the state, has argued for immigration restrictions and called for targeted surveillance of Muslim neighborhoods. He has been the most severe opponent of what he calls of the ‘Washington establishment,’ which he says, is a coalition of Republican and Democratic leaderships against common Americans. His disagreement with Mr Trump has not been that he is an outlier or an extremist, but that he has been part of this establishment. Mr Kasich on the other hand, showcases his popularity in Ohio where he is governor, which is built on a slew of welfare measures that he has pioneered. He is a strong advocate of state support for the vulnerable sections, particularly for the mentally ill and the drug-addled. Contrary to Mr Cruz’s self projection of being an uncompromising conservative, Mr Kasich has consistently projected an image of being a compassionate conservative, who is willing to, and has, brokered bipartisan deals to get the government moving. He has opposed both Mr Trump and Mr Cruz for their extreme views, including on the question of profiling Muslims. Mr Kasich is the only one among the three Republicans in the fray, who has a chance to win the general election, according to polls. If Republican dealmakers can indeed get him elected the nominee, the landscape of the U.S presidential election could dramatically change. He had finished second in New York last week and is posed do well in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania on Tuesday, in the next batch of primaries. &quot;Our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Governor Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico, and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our lead,&quot; said Jeff Roe, Cruz&apos;s campaign manager. &quot;In other states holding their elections for the remainder of the primary season, our campaign will continue to compete vigorously to win.” John Weaver, Mr Kasich&apos;s manager said in a simultaneous statement: &quot;Due to the fact that the Indiana primary is winner-take-all statewide and by congressional district, keeping Trump from winning a plurality in Indiana is critical to keeping him under 1,237 bound delegates before Cleveland. We are very comfortable with our delegate position in Indiana already, and given the current dynamics of the primary there, we will shift our campaign’s resources west and give the Cruz campaign a clear path in Indiana.&quot; Speaking to reporters during campaign in Pennsylvania on Monday morning, Mr Kasich said the deal with Mr Cruz was a “fair one” but sought to underplay its significance. “I am in this race because of I am the only one who can beat Hillary. I am going to do everything I can to ensure that…I don’t think this is any big deal. I am not going to spend resources in Indiana and he is not going to spend in other places. What is the big deal?” Mr Kasich said. He said as long as a candidate has not won a majority before the convention, the contest would remain open. Asked whether he would ask his supporters in Indiana to vote for Mr Cruz, Mr Kasich said: “They ought to vote for me. I am not going campaign in Indiana and he is not going to campaign in the other two states,” he said.

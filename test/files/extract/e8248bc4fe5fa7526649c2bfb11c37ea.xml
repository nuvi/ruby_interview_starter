5 Golden Eyeshadow Palettes 15:03 Alice Grace If you take a peek at my beauty collection, there&apos;s one makeup item that takes over - eyeshadow palettes. From the heady heights of Tom Ford to the blogger-enabled UD Naked palettes, I&apos;ve always been suckered in by pretty palettes, especially when they contain golden tones. Being a neutral lover, I&apos;ve amassed enough to sink a ship, so I thought I&apos;d share a few of my favourites with you, featuring some that won&apos;t break the bank and a couple worth splashing out on. If you&apos;re looking for an affordable option, then the Sleek i-Lust The Gold Standard Eyeshadow Palette * is an absolute beaut. Containing four, powder shadows and two creams, the one palette allows you to create a multitude of looks, appropriate for both day and night. For such a bargain brand, the textures are impressively smooth and blend-able and the pigmentation is surprisingly good (although applying a primer first boosts the intensity and longevity even further). The cream shadows do crease slightly when worn alone, but I love using them for an undone, imperfect-perfect kind of finish. Just look at that stunning line-up of shades, too! Another high-street palette I&apos;ve been loving recently, is the MaxFactor Smokey Eye Drama Kit in Sumptuous Gold . Whilst the two, lighter eyeshadows have quite a glittery finish, the two darker shades have more of a satin finish, so can be used to contour and add definition. Even the lightest touch of a brush picks up a heap of product, but the result is quite sheer and pretty when the powders are blended well with a fluffy brush. When packed on with flat, tightly-packed bristles, you can build up the colour quickly, though. What&apos;s great about this compact, is the tiny size of it, which is ideal for slotting into your makeup bag when on-the-go or travelling, to give you everything needed to create a warm, smokey eye. If you prefer your golden shades to be a bit brighter and less warm-toned, then the Shiseido Luminous Satin Eye Colour Trio in BR209 is ideal. Texture-wise, these powder eyeshadows are so finely-milled, making them velvety soft and smooth. The colours simply melt into the skin when blended, so I love using this trio when I&apos;m in a hurry and want a quick, flawless finish. Compared to the others I&apos;ve mentioned, these shadows don&apos;t have such a strong shimmer to them, making them perfect for daytime looks or for people who prefer a less in-your-face finish. If you want a palette that can give you an ultra-glam, sparkly result, then look no further than the YSL Pure Chromatics Wet &amp; Dry Eyeshadow Palette in 20 . Used dry, these shadows give a sheer, glittery look, but when mixed with a drop water, the drama is ramped up and an opaque, metallic gleam can be achieved, with the intensity guaranteed to last all day/night. I always pull this palette out when I&apos;m heading for a night on the tiles and I always get compliments on my eye makeup, whenever I use it. Plus, the luxe, decadent packaging that YSL always create is pretty hard to resist! The formula of the Estee Lauder Pure Colour Eyeshadow Trio in 05 Gilded Chocolates is what sets this palette apart from the rest. Although they&apos;re powder eyeshadows, you could be fooled into thinking they had a cream consistency, thanks to the gel-like, buttery-smooth texture and amazing longevity. Even with just one swipe of your brush, these shadows give such strong pigmentation that refuses to crease or fade for around ten hours. Again, this is another palette perfect for carrying in your makeup bag, as it&apos;s so small and includes a handy mirror in the lid. Which of these palettes do you like the most? AGB X

Glenn Maxwell finally clicked in the 2016 IPL, but not quite with the same firepower that he has been known for and that could mean only one thing for Kings XI Punjab - another loss that confines KXIP to the last position in the points tally. In Match 21 of the 2016 IPL, KXIP (164/7) never got going in chase of a formidable total of 189 set by Mumbai Indians, that was made courtesy fifties from Parthiv Patel (81) and Ambati Rayudu (65), and some stellar death bowling from Jasprit Bumrah (3/26) and Mitchell McClenaghan (2/32) helped MI beat KXIP by 25 runs at the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium, Mohali on Monday. 

Going in to the home stretch, the match seemed evenly poised with KXIP at 121 for 2 with 5.1 overs to go. The equation was 69 needed off 31 balls with Maxwell batting on 48 and Shaun Marsh on 45. The calibre of both the set batsmen would have made one assume the game is for KXIP&apos;s taking from here on, but MI bowlers bowled remarkably well and the turning point proved to be Marsh&apos;s wicket off the last ball of the 15th over - last ball of Tim Southee&apos;s spell as well. Marsh timed a flick to perfection only to find Rayudu at deep square leg and his departure on 45 took KXIP downhill faster than a boulder rolling down a slope. 

MI conceded mere 45 runs in last five overs, with the 17th and 18th going for only six and two, respectively. David Miller hit a six off Kieron Pollard in the 16th after Maxwell had reached his fifty with a couple. But, McClenaghan got six balls right on the money in the next over and Bumrah followed it with the wickets of Maxwell (56 off 39 balls) - with a slower delivery and Nikhil Naik -with a perfect yorker to dash any hopes of KXIP winning the game. 

After losing openers Murali Vijay (19) and Manan Vohra (7) early in the chase, Maxwell and Marsh did well to well rebuild the KXIP innings, but MI bowlers managed to keep a tab on the run-rate with some tidy bowling and that pretty much put KXIP behind the eight-ball for the entire duration of the chase. Tim Southee was brilliant upfront conceding just 28 runs in his four overs while Harbhajan Singh returned figures of 4-0-31-0. 

Earlier, after the departure of Rohit Sharma in the very first over of the match Parthiv and Rayudu had combined for a 137-run stand for the second wicket to power MI to a formidable total of 189 for six. 

After Sandeep Sharma managed to get a faint edge from Rohit&apos;s bat off the second ball of the match, Parthiv and Rayudu scratched their way early on in each other&apos;s company and proceeded to dominate a lacklustre KXIP bowling attack en route to this year&apos;s fourth highest partnership off just 85 balls. 

While Rayudu perished for 65 (37b, 4x4, 4x6) in the 15th over, Parthiv went on to register his highest IPL score and his first half-century this season scoring 81 off 51 balls studded with ten fours and two sixes. KXIP did well to finish strong with the ball, lead by Mohit Sharma (3/38), but could not stop MI from posting their highest total of the season so far. 

While MI batsmen enjoyed their day out, it came at the expense of KXIP&apos;s shoddy work in the field and with the ball. After Sandeep&apos;s terrific first over, KXIP&apos;s bowling unit was exposed and despite Parthiv and Rayudu struggling to get going early on, the fact the duo managed to occupy the crease for 14.1 overs brought to the fore the lack of penetrative force in KXIP&apos;s bowling. 

MI managed only 25 runs in their first five overs, but in their next 10, Parthiv and Rayudu accumulated 115 with the pair throwing their bat at almost everything that came their way. As the runs started to flow courtesy some edges and misfields, confidence started to grow for the duo. They were particularly severe on spinners Pardeep Sahu and Axar Patel who were guilty of bowling too short. Rayudu hit a six and four off Axar in the 12th over en route to his fifty off just 29 balls while Parthiv brought up his half-century in the next over before taking Mohit for two consecutive fours. 

Jos Buttler entertained for a brief while courtesy some unconventional stroke-making that fetched him 24 runs off 13 balls before falling victim to Mohit Sharma. Parthiv then fell to a Mitchell Johnson bouncer and Mohit Sharma bowled a stellar last over bowling four dot balls, which included two wickets and gave away just four runs to stop MI from posting a total in excess of 200. 

Brief Scores: Mumbai Indians 189/6 (Parthiv 89, Rayudu 65; Mohit 3/38) beat Kings XI Punjab 164/7 (Maxwell 56, Marsh 45; Bumrah 3/26) by 25 runs

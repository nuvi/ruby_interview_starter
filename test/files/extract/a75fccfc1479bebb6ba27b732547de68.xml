(HARRY FISHER / The Morning Call) Bethlehem Catholic&apos;s &apos;Wonderful Town&apos; was wonderful 
Kudos to all the high school musicals in the area. These kids give their heart and soul to create magnificent entertainment. I attended Bethlehem Catholic&apos;s musical, &quot;Wonderful Town.&quot; It was fantastic! These kids put forth a terrific effort to put on a show that meets Broadway standards. The singing was amazing. The Freddy awards are a wonderful way to evoke talent that normally would not have been brought to light.

Mopreme Shakur, Macadoshis, and Big Syke, the remaining members of Thug Life, spoke exclusively to VladTV about how 2Pac heavily advocated for Interscope to sign them after he formed the group. Syke explained that it took a lot of persuading from 2Pac to convince the label, and he added that they then faced an uphill battle with censorship on Thug Life: Volume 1 . Speaking more about their debut project, Syke revealed that the original planned album wasn&apos;t what was released to the public, and he added that popular songs like &quot;How Long Will They Mourn Me&quot; originally were featured on the project. 
During the interview the three artists were also asked about their gang ties, and Big Syke explained that he doesn&apos;t promote his &apos;hood, because he believes that it&apos;s nothing to play with. He then added that he went to jail when he was a teenager for living the street life, but Syke said that he doesn&apos;t want to promote that lifestyle in the media.

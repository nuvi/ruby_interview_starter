Facebook Reportedly Building Standalone Camera App; Going ‘Camera-First’ with Focus on Live Streaming Posted by Evan Selleck   
Facebook has been going to town with its live streaming efforts, and a new report indicates the effort is still ongoing. 
According to a report published by The Wall Street Journal , Facebook is currently hard at work on building a standalone camera app, which will have a big focus on live streaming content. The report indicates that a team based in London, the “friend-sharing” team, is currently working on the app, and that a prototype of the service has already been developed. 
With it, users will launch the app which will automatically go into a camera mode, and allow users to either take a photo or video, or easily begin live streaming: 
“A prototype of the app developed by Facebook’s “friend-sharing” team in London opens to a camera, similar to disappearing photo app Snapchat, the people said. Another planned feature allows a user recording video through the app to begin live streaming, they added.” 
Facebook Live is a big part of the social network’s future, so hearing about another Facebook app makes sense. Of course, Facebook isn’t a stranger to a standalone camera app, as the social network has released one in the past. However, this sounds like Facebook is taking it much more seriously this time around. 
As far as a release date goes, that remains unknown.

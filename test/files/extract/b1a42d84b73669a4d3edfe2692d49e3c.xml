Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 11:53 AM Updated at 1:39 PM Posted Apr 25, 2016 at 11:53 AM Updated at 1:39 PM Hamilton creator and recent Pulitzer Prize winner Lin-Manuel Miranda stopped by Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Sunday, where he delivered yet another history lesson (in rap form, of course). This time, Miranda - whose parents are Puerto Rican and who spent his childhood summers at his grandparents&apos; home in Puerto Rico - tackled Puerto Rico&apos;s debt crisis. &quot;This is an island a hundred miles across / a hurricane is comin&apos; and we&apos;re runnin&apos; up a loss,&quot; the Hamilton star raps, begging Congress to grant &quot;not a bailout, just relief&quot; to the commonwealth, which is $72 billion in debt. (He even offers to perform Hamilton in Paul Ryan&apos;s house.) In March, Miranda spoke before Congress in order to bring awareness to Puerto Rico&apos;s financial crisis, which has prompted delays in individual tax returns, as well as medicinal rations and hospital closings - even amid the spread of the Zika virus. Watch Miranda&apos;s impassioned plea in the video above, beginning around 19:00. Other Links From TVGuide.com

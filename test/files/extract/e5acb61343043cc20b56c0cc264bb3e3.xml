The power of PLAY works for everyone. Only imagine what could happen if 1000 players use their imagination and create whatever they can think of with FOOOTY. Opportunities are endless; we can’t wait to see what more people around the world can create &amp; do together. 
TEAM ON A MISSION 
FOOOTY is an initiative of Jean-Pierre Raes, founder of Westerlab, a Amsterdam based co-creation platform aimed at developing &amp; realizing new ideas with positive impact. JP loves smart products that bring people together, stimulate creativity and on top of that, make life more fun and spread happiness. 
Passionate about playing and always missing a ball for his kids to play with when on the move, JP teamed up with industrial designer Lard Breebaart of Natwerk to find a solution and designed the FOOOTY. Production development and sustainability research is done in close cooperation with engineering studio BetterFutureFactory . 
KICKSTARTER GOAL: 1000 FOOOTY-players 
Until now, we lasercut each FOOOTY-element individually, only for personal use and test drives. We believe that FOOOTY deserves a much bigger stage, since everyone in the world has a right to play with FOOOTY. 
To make our product come alive &amp; kicking, we are initiating this Kickstarter project. We need sufficient support to develop a production mould to produce the first batch of FOOOTIES and minimize material waste. 
Our goal is to reach at least 1000 PLAYERS . We estimate that if 500 people would pre-order at least two FOOOTIES, we will reach our necessary production investment goal of 15.000 euro . 
So, support us today if you love to play and if you want others to play as well. By supporting us today, you will become one of the first worldwide FOOOTY owners! 
KICKSTARTER REWARDS 
For your support, you will receive the first FOOOTIES produced in a batch and … endless gratitude for helping us make this happen ☺. We offer different packages to become a player yourself or to enable your kids, friends, schools, colleagues or business partners to play more. 
Time to delivery: you will receive your FOOOTY reward before the summer starts! The FOOOTIES are nicely stacked with a band to keep them together. 
FOOOTY: materials 
The first batch of FOOOTY will be made out of 100% recyclable Polypropylene. PP has a high impact resistance, is odourless and safe to use for kids and adults. This material is extremely tough and therefore, may be hinged and folded endlessly without the material breaking. 
We feel very much the obligation to design in a responsible way to protect the environment as much as we can. Together with the BetterFutureFactory , we continue to explore how we can improve sustainability performance of the FOOOTY. For example, we are exploring how we could use bottle caps, and upgrade them into FOOOTIES. 
Join our campaign and let’s play!

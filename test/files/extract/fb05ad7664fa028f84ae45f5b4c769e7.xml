Bob Hardy, an educator whose service to the Ontario-Montclair School District spanned more than half a century, died April 14 . He was 92 and died at home, family by his side. 
“Bob was obviously an iconic figure in our community, with a legacy not only as a teacher but as a board member,” Superintendent James Hammond said Friday. 
Hired in 1952, Hardy taught such disparate subjects as physical education, math, wood shop and Spanish at Vina Danks and Vernon junior high schools. Transitioning to administration in 1965, he was assistant principal at the former Imperial and Vernon junior highs and principal of Ramona Elementary until his 1985 retirement. 
He wasn’t done yet. Two years later, he was elected to the district’s Board of Trustees, where he served for 21 years until stepping down in 2009. 
The district, the third-largest elementary school district in California, serves more than 22,000 students. 
According to his bio on the district’s website , Hardy “made enormous contributions of time and energy to improve the education of students and working environment for the district’s certificated, classified and management staff.” 
Since 1998, training for district employees has taken place in a building named the Robert Hardy Professional Center, 950 W. D St. in Ontario. 
Hardy mentored people on his own, using schools, restaurants, tennis courts and the telephone as his training center. 
Bob Gallagher was in his 20s when he phoned Hardy, then the board president, out of the blue to nervously ask about interviewing him, a requirement for his teaching credential. “The next morning, at 7 a.m., he’s buying me breakfast,” Gallagher recalled in awe. 
Now the district’s human resources director, Gallagher said Hardy later invited him to be his tennis partner, regularly outplaying him despite being 40 years older, and would start phone conversations by mentioning how Gallagher’s favorite team had performed. “He would build relationships with people on a personal level,” Gallagher said. 
Hardy was legendary for his school visits as a board member, dropping by unannounced, observing each classroom and writing up a report. Teachers would flock around the bulletin board to read them and, because Hardy didn’t use names, try to glean which classroom was theirs for bragging rights. 
“He would focus on what was going well at that school,” said Hector Macias, then a teacher at Euclid Elementary, a school in a depressed part of Ontario. “Because of where we were, we needed that positive pump. He never had anything bad to say.” Advertisement 
Hammond, hired in 2010, recalled a half-dozen dinners with the retired board member, always at the same place, Tony’s Spunky Steer in Chino, where Hardy would order a bacon-wrapped sirloin, butterflied and well-done, and offer advice and encouragement to the new leader. 
“You can just see the genuineness of everything he was about,” Hammond said. 
A resident of Ontario for 64 years, Hardy served on the Parks and Recreation Commission and the Youth Accountability Board, was a member of Ontario Parkway Kiwanis and was president of the American Legion. 
Born Dec. 20, 1923 in Tomah, Wisconsin, he enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1943 and was assigned to three stateside naval air stations in San Diego, El Toro and Miramar, serving until his discharge in 1946. He married LaVerne Drews in 1947 and graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
With a growing family to support, Hardy found other ways to earn money in his summers off as a teacher. He drove a Helms Bakery truck, sold clothes in the evenings at the John P. Evans store in Pomona and worked at the Youth Training School in Chino. 
He loved Notre Dame football, hunting, fishing, camping, playing tennis, needlework and woodworking. 
“He always had a calling to serve,” Hammond observed. “He was a Marine, a Midwestern guy, played football in college. He just had service in his heart. He found his niche working with children.” 
Macias, now the district’s assistant human resources director, said of Hardy: “He had a love of bringing out the best in people. He wanted you to be the best version of yourself.” 
Besides his wife, survivors include eight children, 15 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. 
Services were Friday and burial was in Bellevue Memorial Park. Donations were requested to Promise Scholars , which prepares students to be successful.

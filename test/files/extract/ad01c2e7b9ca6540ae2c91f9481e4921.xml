“Y ou haven’t lived until you’ve sucked the head of a spicy boiled crawfish,” says Alon Shaya, the bespectacled Israeli chef who makes the best hummus New Orleans diners have ever tasted . The restaurant is nominated as America’s Best New Restaurant by the James Beard Foundation, to be announced on 2 May in Chicago.
There’s no Cajun crawfish boil on the menu at Shaya’s year-old Israeli restaurant Shaya, which is one of the hardest New Orleans spots to get a table at. Yet Shaya proudly owes the ardor for his ancient tabbouleh recipe and foie gras with carob molasses to the spicy, stewy, fishy, meaty Cajun and Creole dishes. “Cajun and Creole are the blood that runs through the veins of our city,” he says of the two reining Nola cuisines.
There’s a joke in New Orleans lore that there might be 100 restaurants in the city, and only one menu. That’s not so true these days – Shaya’s James Beard nomination is one of eight this year for New Orleans, the most the city has ever gotten and trailing just behind the culinary heartlands of New York, Chicago and San Francisco. 
But nine million tourists visit the city each year as much for the history, as for the future. “Fine dining restaurants are dependent on the hole in the wall restaurants to keep our culture alive. It’s a symbiotic relationship. Without the fried chicken and the gumbo, nothing else can survive.”
These are strong words in a city about which critics were questioning the way New Orleans was rebuilt after Hurricane Katrina. Now, with Louisiana’s economy at the lowest it’s been in a generation , the ever brightening spotlight on the city’s culinary scene might be more essential than ever. Shaya is one of the young stars winning big food world prizes and driving a culinary renaissance that is landing the city on coveted Best City lists.
“Among nine million visitors, the highest expenditure is on food,” says Scott Hutcheson, adviser for Culture Economy to New Orleans’ mayor Mitch Landrieu. Since Katrina, restaurants have opened at a rapid pace and employment in the industry has risen 99%. “When New Orleans does well, the state does well.”
Anyone trawling food blogs might imagine today’s New Orleans as a hot bed of the well-coiffed artisanal dining world, teeming with ambitious mixologists and bunsen-burner-wielding chefs. And there is some of that. 
The city’s post-Katrina revival has brought new waves of residents and new appetites and cuisines along with them. White-walled macaroon cafes are popping up alongside falafel spots and neighborhood kitchens for Filipino, Honduran and Mexican food. 
Michael Gulatto, who is also up for Best Chef South, broke in 2014 from the empire of John Besh – who owns 11 iconic New Orleans restaurants – to open MoPho with a menu of Southeast Asian cuisine, microbrews, weird cocktails and pig flesh : essentially a contemporary fusion of Louisianan and southeast Asian cuisines. “We have a more diverse food scene than ever in recent history, but our Creole culture is what we are most proud of,” he says.

“It’s important to stick with our history, which means everyone has their own way,” says Leah Chase, the beloved 93-year old chef who James Beard is honoring with a lifetime achievement award. Chase owns Dooky Chase’s, a red brick, white tablecloth restaurant in the heart of Treme, which Chase rebuilt after Katrina to keep the meeting place that her father opened in 1941. Back then, New Orleans kitchens were run by African Americans bringing their family recipes to crowds sipping Sazeracs in the dining rooms. “I cook the food my grandmother before me cooked and that’s what people come for.”
Chase’s award is welcome in a city that is majority African American, a fact still more reflected in the food than in the media adoring it.
“In New Orleans, you have Creoles and you have Creoles. You might go to Commander’s Palace and eat andouille because their ancestors are Spanish and French. When you come to my restaurant, I tell you I’m Creole too and I include some French, some Spanish and a whole lot of African. The Spanish came by way of the islands and they picked up flavors from Haiti and Jamaica.”
Chase is beloved for her fried chicken and her okra-free gumbo loaded with ground sassafras, known as Filé powder. (She makes a traditional gumbo with okra on Fridays, “but that’s a special thing”.) She has also explained to many a tourist the difference between Creole and Cajun, which are eternally confused. Cajun is the fare that exiled French-speaking immigrants created from local ingredients like green bell peppers, black pepper and lots of pork in a tiny section of southeast Louisiana called Arcadia. Creole is an evolving mixture of African, French and Spanish born of the settlers of New Orleans.
“If you bring your food here” Chase says, “we’re going to Creolize it.”

Grr, don&apos;t know how I typed the extra L in his name...Sorry Michael (Gulotta!). 
The rest stands though. I don;t even know why I bother to click on the New Orleans articles. It&apos;s as if they&apos;re simply phoned in by some gap year blogger a lot of the time...

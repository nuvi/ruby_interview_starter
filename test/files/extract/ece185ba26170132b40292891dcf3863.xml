Max Strus will stay close to home to play Division I basketball.
Strus, who was granted his release from Lewis University last month, has committed to DePaul .
&quot;DePaul was the place that I felt made the most sense for me,&quot; Strus said. &quot;I felt really comfortable there. I get along with all the players and coaches and I think the program&apos;s headed in the right direction.
&quot;I just hope I can contribute to getting DePaul basketball back to where it once was, being a contender for championships.&quot;
Strus, a 6-foot-6 guard and Stagg graduate, will sit out next season per NCAA transfer rules, then will have two seasons of eligibility remaining.
John Daniels, who coached him at Stagg, always envisioned Strus would be a Division I player.
&quot;His senior year at Stagg, I worked really hard trying to get information on him out to the Division I schools in our state,&quot; Daniels said. &quot;People looked at him as too small, but I knew he&apos;d grow. He&apos;s very athletic and he&apos;s the first one in the gym and the last one to leave. He earned this chance and now he has to go out and prove himself.&quot;
Pat Disabato: Stagg grad Max Strus leaving Lewis for Division I chance Pat Disabato Max Strus always dreamed of playing Division I college basketball.
With the exception of a scholarship offer from Chicago State, that opportunity didn&apos;t present itself following his career at Stagg.
So Strus opted for Lewis, a Division II program, and dominated the competition during two seasons...

So Strus opted for Lewis, a Division II program, and dominated the competition during two seasons...
(Pat Disabato) Strus dominated at the Division II level, earning All-American honors in averaging 20.2 points, 8.4 rebounds and 3.5 assists this past season for Lewis. He led the Flyers in all three categories.
He was the MVP of the Great Lakes Valley Conference Tournament, guiding the Flyers to the title, and was named one of 25 players selected to the watch list for the Bevo Francis Award, which is given to the top player in small-college basketball.
Strus turned heads on Nov. 24 when he exploded for 52 points in a win over Northwood. In that game, he shot 14-for-18, including 12-for-14 on 3-pointers. He also went 12-for-12 on free throws.
In March, Strus explained his decision to transfer from Lewis.
&quot;Ever since I started playing basketball, it&apos;s been my dream to play at the Division I level,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that my two years at Lewis put me in position to do that.&apos;
Strus also took official visits to Butler and Xavier and had offers from UIC and Toledo.

(Steve Millar) &quot;I wasn&apos;t really thinking about staying close to home,&quot; he said. &quot;I just wanted to pick the right school. Fortunately, it worked out that it&apos;s close to home.&quot;
Coming out of high school, Strus&apos; only Division I offer was from Chicago State. He picked Lewis instead and started all 64 games the Flyers played in his two seasons there. He averaged 13.3 points his freshman season.
Now, Strus will get his chance to play in the Big East .
&quot;I&apos;m living my dream,&quot; he said.

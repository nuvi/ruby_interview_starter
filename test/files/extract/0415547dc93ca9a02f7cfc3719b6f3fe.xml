&apos;PlayDate&apos; let&apos;s you play with your pet while you&apos;re away WCSH 6:32 AM. EST April 25, 2016 
(NEWS CENTER) -- We get it. You love your pets. 
And leaving them alone for the day just breaks your heart. 
A new Indiegogo project, PlayDate, lets you play with your dog or cat from anywhere in the world, via their smart ball and mobile app. 
According to the project funding website, you can control PlayDate&apos;s smart ball remotely from your iOS or Android device after downloading the free app from the App Store or Google Play. 
&quot;There is a navigation controller on the left. On the right, there are buttons that trigger actions like playing a “squeak” or taking a picture/recording video,&quot; the website states. &quot;Similar to a hamster ball, the PlayDate smart ball rolls around wherever you direct it. A stabilized camera inside lets you see all the action in smooth, real-time HD. And, a clear, replaceable outer shell protects the inner workings but allows the camera to see out clearly.&quot; 
PlayDate has already recieved $139,814 of their $60,000 goal.

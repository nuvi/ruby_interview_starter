Monday, 22 February 2016 Meatless Monday - Red Curry Noodles with loads of veggies Back to Meatless Monday-ing :) I have a new favourite mid-week meal. Easy, quick and full of veggies. I took a short cut by having ready made red curry paste but I did add some seasoning to it, some extra ginger, garlic, lemongrass and kaffir lime. I have made it a few times now and served it with noodles and with rice when I had some leftovers. Here is the result the first time I tried it after work one night: You can basically use whichever veggies you happen to have in the fridge or the freezer, but here is what I have used the first night, I had cabbage, coco beans, bean sprouts, peppers, frozen edamame and straw mushrooms. I also used some onions and fried up some shallots until crispy, as well as some tofu. Closer view of the various veggies :) I wanted some extra protein as this is a vegetarian / vegan dish so I decided to make some crispy tofu with just a little oil in a pan. I recommend drying the tofu out a bit when you have sliced it. Put it on a medium heat so it doesn&apos;t burn and turn it over regularly so it browns on all sides. I used my big Le Creuset and started off some onions in the bottom. I didn&apos;t want them to brown, I had the fried shallots for that. I then added ginger, 3 chillies, a couple of cloves of garlic and kaffir lime leaves as I adore the flavour. Next the peppers and the sliced coco beans but not for too long as they need to retain their crunch as one of the great things about this dish is all the textures, some soft, some crisp, some crunch. Add a couple of tables spoons of the red curry paste. Mix it through and let it fry off a bit. Start adding some coconut milk. I used about a tin of 400 ml in total. Next I added the frozen edamame and straw mushrooms for some extra protein and flavour. But it needed some extra coconut milk so I had enough sauce as the goal for this first attempt was soupy kind of noodles. Looking better. I also added some seasoning such as soy sauce, don&apos;t add fish sauce it you want it to be vegan, but you can if you want that extra savoury depth. Next I added some sliced cabbage which is awesome as some of it more or less melts and the parts closer to the centre remain crunchy. Again, different textures for the win. I had some Thai Basil so I added it. And some beansprouts for some added crunch right at the end. Result! And add in the crispy tofu. Done! Check for seasoning and I then squeezed some kaffir lime into it for that sour note to balance out the sweet richness of the coconut, the spice from the curry paste and added chillies and the savoury from the soy sauce. Served on top of the rice noodles I had cooked separately so they could retain their bite and I could reheat the curry for work and add the noodles in afterwards. if you store the leftovers with the noodles in the sauce they fall apart which sucks. Topped with the crispy shallots and some coriander leaves. So yummy! It does make a bit of a mess when you eat it though but so tasty and full of different flavours and textures. 2nd attempt I made the tofu again but then I added some soy sauce to flavour the tofu towards the end, it really really helped! Again, cooked the onions with the seasonings until they were a little translucent, not further. Added the curry paste up front this time but you need to watch it like a hawk so that it doesn&apos;t stick, adding more oil and / or soy sauce if needed to stop it burning. Peppers and beans again next. Cabbage and straw mushrooms. Coconut milk next. I used less than last time as this time I didn&apos;t want it to be soupy, more of a curry sauce that clings to the noodles. Add the soy sauce and kaffir lime juice (I used one lime but I also added a little of the peel for another dimension to the sauce). Noodles again cooked separately (soaked for an hour and then brought to the boil for a minute or two). Curry sauce on top. And again the crispy tofu and fried shallots on top. I cook the shallots in a small Le Creuset pan, on a medium heat with enough oil to nearly cover them, turning them frequently so they brown but don&apos;t burn. Love that caramelised flavour! Done and s good. All mixed together, you can see it is a sauce not a soup and it is very very tasty. I brought it into work for lunch, storing the tofu with the shallots, the noodles in one box and the curry sauce in yet another box. Reheat them and merge them at the end to make all your colleagues very jealous :) Everyone was commenting about how good it smelled and looked and I may have felt just slightly smug ;) I made enough for three meals so I served it over rice on the third day for lunch and it was still just as good, so a really versatile meal that reheats well and stores well in the fridge.

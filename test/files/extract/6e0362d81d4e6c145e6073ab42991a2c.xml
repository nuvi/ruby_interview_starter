PARIS — France&apos;s six rail unions have issued a joint call for a one-day strike that is set to disrupt local and national train traffic, but not international lines. 
State railway company SNCF is warning that only half of the local trains in the Paris region and half of the TGV high-speed trains are expected to run on Tuesday. The Paris Metro subway system is not affected by the strike. 
SNCF says the Eurostar train line to London and the Thalys trains to Belgium should run normally on Tuesday. 
French unions are protesting a plan to change working hours and rules about days off.

Gravestone Girls founder explains symbolism of old graveyard art Comment Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 10:23 AM By Robert Barboza/Special Writer Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 10:23 AM » Social News ACUSHNET — For many local history lovers, there’s nothing more enjoyable than walking around an old burial ground on a pleasant spring or summer day, looking for clues about the lives and times of the folks laid to rest there centuries ago. Area history buffs got a chance to do just that April 14 when Gravestone Girls founder Brenda Sullivan took nearly 40 of them on an illustrated lecture tour of Acushnet’s oldest cemeteries, explaining the meaning of the diverse artwork and symbols on the gravestones to be found there. The educational event at the new library on Middle Road was sponsored by the Friends of the Acushnet Public Library and funded in part by a grant from the Community Foundation of Southeastern Massachusetts. The 90-minute presentation featured many photographs taken last summer at the 10 burial grounds around Acushnet, some dating back to the 1600s and 1700s. The talk also charted the evolution of cemeteries from the colonial era into the 21st century, and how the artwork displayed on gravestones changed to reflect the period. As the last slide suggested, “Cemeteries are fun, interesting, and educational places, as well as a valuable resource for information” about the past. “Go explore.” Sullivan&apos;s interest in the subject started at an early age, with the encouragement of her mother. She said, “It began with taking rubbings (of gravestones) at the family cemetery when I was a little kid.&quot; Later, as an adult working in art history and education, Sullivan was fascinated with collecting headstone rubbings. That morphed into a hobby of reproducing the engraved images on gravestones using a hard synthetic material that resembles the gray slate used to mark graves in colonial times. Creating the reproductions and lecturing about burial ground art is now a full-time business for Sullivan and the pair of other “Gravestone Girls” associated with the company. The exploratory photo tour of the Acushnet burial grounds titled “Welcome to the Graveyard” included pictures of everything from the simple fieldstone gravestone markers used by early Quaker settlers to the towering and ornate “white bronze” monuments that wealthy 19th century inhabitants erected to memorialize their loved ones. Most of the focus, though, was on the earliest burying grounds around town, starting with the Acushnet Cemetery on Main Road, also known as the Queen Anne burial ground, established around 1711. The term cemetery, from the Greek word for sleeping or resting place, didn’t come into use until the 1830s, she explained. Other early sites in town visited on the photo tour included the Ancient Long Plain Burial Ground, dating back to around 1726, and the Friends Burying Ground on North Main, established around 1756. It is hard to pinpoint the earliest grave markers, especially those of Quakers, because they used common fieldstones, often not engraved with a name or date, to mark the burial locations. Those colonial graves soon had both head and footstones used to precisely mark a burial site, with the corpse buried facing east so they would be ready to face their Maker on Judgement Day, the historian noted. The headstone would be engraved with basic facts such as the deceased’s name and date of death, while the footstone simply had the departed’s initials on it or was left blank. The earliest art on gravestones was the “death’s head” representation of a skull, symbolizing death, often fringed with wings intended to symbolism the expected journey up to heaven. The artwork speaks to the Pilgrim and Puritan obsessions with “mortality and morality” that pervaded everyday life for the early settlers. “It was a society where the smallest transgression could lead to eternal damnation,” Sullivan explained, and settlers were constantly reminded that death could come for anyone at any time. The early addition of artwork like the death’s head skull helped convey that message “in a picture language for a society that was largely illiterate,” she added. Sullivan gave an example of a gravestone for the few that were literate and educated, inscribed with the Latin phrase “Momento Mori” meaning “remember your mortality.” By the 1720s, the simple skull art begins to become a little more detailed, with Acushnet gravestones with death’s heads starting to include features like hair, eyes and lips, with bigger wings helping the deceased make a faster and easier trip up to heaven. The more humanistic features illustrate a move away from the early Puritan objections to “graven images” in everyday life. Next came other symbols of death and mourning — the hourglass representing a limited time on earth; the skeleton holding a scythe (a cutting tool used on plants), and even crossed bones, adapted by pirates of the time as a flag symbol warning to surrender or die. By the end of the 1700s, the neo-classical revival after the end of the American Revolution brought Greek urns to represent the grave as holding mortal remains, Roman columns to impress viewers, and the weeping willow tree, as commonly seen in the Ancient Long Plain burial ground. The term cemetery didn’t come into use until around 1831, Sullivan said, when the Mount Auburn Cemetery was established in Cambridge as the first rural “garden” where city dwellers could bury their relations. The old Puritan symbols of death and morality on simple stones are abandoned in favor of more elaborate grave markers, often of imported white marble, with “softer” artwork such as doves, open books, flowers and lambs. As seen in the Victorian section of the Queen Anne’s burial ground, the “new” large family plots that began appearing soon included grand tall monuments surrounded by stone borders, flowering trees or hedges that created little garden parks where families could gather on weekends or holidays for picnics with their ancestors. Often, remains from other smaller private burial grounds would be re-interred at the new site so the entire family could be together for eternity, Sullivan explained. In the 1900s, the backlash against ornate Victorian monuments and sentiments led to a new trend of smaller and simpler stones, often of imported colored granite, laid out in neat rows along paved lanes winding through cemeteries. Farther out of town, and more orderly than old burial grounds, cemeteries gradually become “places we don’t go to very often,” and with less symbolic art, Sullivan noted. Which brings us to the modern era of cemeteries, where the latest trends include laser-etched and engraved monuments to the dead, perhaps engraved with ethnic symbols or pictures of race cars, sailboats, or favorite hobbies. Sullivan said the most modern technology now includes solar-powered video boxes embedded in gravestones, quick response medallions to access obituaries and websites via smart phones, and photoceramic pictures of the deceased, a far cry from the simple fieldstones without names or ornamentation used by early Quakers.

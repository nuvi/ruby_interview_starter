I&apos;ve never witnessed anything like this and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever manage to photograph anything like this again Wim van den Heever Just at the last moment, a bull buffalo comes to the rescue as he charged at the pair who scarpered slightly before turning on him. One of the lionesses jumps on his back but he amazingly managed to shake her off, despite her incredible leg muscles gripping on for life. Wim van den Heever•Caters The lionesses stalked the mother buffalo Wim van den Heever•Caters The two lionesses cornered the buffalo Wim van den Heever•Caters The lioness jumped on the buffalo in a bid to kill it He took the moment to charge at the powerful cat with his sharp horns. The lion was then seen skulking away, soaking and entirely covered in black, looking more like a panther than a lion. Wim van den Heever•Caters The buffalo fended off the lionesses Wim van den Heever•Caters The buffalo speared the lioness with his sharp horns Photographer Wim van den Heever, a 2015 finalist at the National Geographic&apos;s Wildlife Photographer of the Year, said the lioness died two days later from her injuries. The 42-year-old said: &quot;The bull came and chased the female lions off the mother buffalo, trying to injure them. &quot;Luckily they escaped, but while he chases them he sees the injured female lion and really finishes her off by mauling her and pushing her into the mud. &quot;I&apos;ve never witnessed anything like this and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever manage to photograph anything like this again.&quot; Wim van den Heever•Caters The lioness was seen covered in mud, and died two days later from her injuries Wim van den Heever•Caters Wim van den Heever said he may never be able to capture something so amazing again Related videos

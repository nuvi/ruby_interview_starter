By Patricia Era 
You’ve probably heard this line a million times before, but believe in the special touch of Chi, The Spa at EDSA Shangri-La EDSA, which truly commits to the promise of transporting you to a whole new world of leisure in Manila as it continuously raises the bar of the spa industry in the country. In partnership with Turkish Airways, the five-star urban escape opens the season with its newest luxury spa treatment—the traditional Hammam, also known as the Turkish bath experience. Open yourself to a piece of Turkish culture that introduces a new way for Filipinos to uplift the mind, the body, and the spirit. 
Voyage to Istanbul 
The treatment elevates your spa experience by taking on the traditional practice of Hammam or Turkish bath in Istanbul, which flawlessly combines the elements of bath and massage into a euphoric wellness journey. It starts by warming your body inside the spa’s steam room nestled in the burnished wood interior of its lavish bathroom. Once done, step inside the Hammam sanctuary designed with a wide, heated marble-topped bathing slab, cold walls, and bathtub. The female therapist asks you to lie down on the marble bed and slowly pours warm water all over your body. After, she cleanses and exfoliates you from head to toe using an authentic hand-woven wash cloth from Istanbul, known as a kese. This is followed by the pinnacle of your Turkish voyage: she bathes you with olive-oil-and-lavender-filled foam for a unique, sudsy massage. The treatment closes with a body mask, a cold bath, and a fruit serving. The interesting course of treatment may surprise your senses at first, especially for those who haven’t experienced a body scrub before, but know this: Discovering a new way to soothe your stress in an idyllic spa setting within the city is one of the most amazing things you’ll take with you after your session (then your mind wanders to when you can schedule your next).

It’s up to you how you want this Turkish experience to unfold, as Chi offers three kinds of Hammam: Traditional, Luxury, and Royal. Traditional opens with a 45-minute full-body treatment that features a body scrub and a foam massage. The 60-minute Luxury Hammam enhances the traditional treatment by infusing an organic body mask, a hair smoothening wash, and a moisturizing procedure using an organic lotion. But if you want to reward yourself with the finest, opt for the Royal Hammam, as it mixes the luxury treatment with a full-hour Aroma Wellness signature massage that brings together the elements of Swedish, Shiatsu, and Reflexology using Oriental aromatic oils to revitalize physical and mental health. 
Bath Benefits 
Hammam is recognized not just a treatment for stress, but also a remedy for the skin. It rehydrates the skin and soothes redness and dryness, which makes it a perfect post-beach refuge. Scrubbing lightens the skin, as it removes dead skin cells. And with the rich oil and ingredients for cleansing, it prevents anti-aging and acne. It also enhances blood circulation and soothes muscle sore. There’s nothing like indulging yourself with a spa treatment to please your outer and inner being. Related Posts:

&apos;Innovation has become extremely slow&apos; Published: 22 mins ago 
(CNBC) — Apple is “outdated” and losing momentum in China, billionaire entrepreneur Jia Yueting told CNBC in his first international television interview. 
Jia is chief executive and chairman of Chinese conglomerate LeEco (formerly LeTV), which is best known for being the “Netflix of China,” but has a product range that includes smartphones, televisions, mountain bikes and, most recently, electric vehicles. 
Last week LeEco launched the self-driving, smart LeSEE supercar, designed to rival Tesla’s Model X. In the latest evolution of the “LeEco ecosystem,” Jia hopes to sell content, including movies, TV shows and music to LeSEE drivers.

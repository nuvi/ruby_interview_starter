Tiffany Howard was one of five players with a hit Sunday. Jay G. Tate/AuburnSports.com AUBURN | The Tigers&apos; bats weren&apos;t much of a force Sunday, but they made their presence known at just the right time.
Pitchers Lexi Davis and Rachael Walters handled the rest.
Madi Gipson&apos;s RBI single tied the game during the sixth inning while Courtney Shea&apos;s RBI groundout moments later created all the scoring Auburn needed. The Tigers won 2-1 and earned a series sweep over Georgia.
It&apos;s the team&apos;s fourth series sweep in a row against Southeastern Conference opponents.
&quot;It (was) a complete effort for us as far as what we needed to do,&quot; Auburn coach Clint Myers said. &quot;If you keep (Georgia) off the bases, that limits their chances to score.&quot;
The Bulldogs entered the weekend as the league&apos;s top hitting team, but they struggled to gain any advantages against Auburn&apos;s pitchers Sunday. Davis, who started the game, left a changeup down the middle for Georgia&apos;s Alyssa DiCarlo during the fourth inning.
That mistake was deposited over the wall in left field.
It was a jarring development for a game that had moved briskly to that point due to efficient pitching from both teams. Auburn watched a two-out rally stall during the fifth inning with Kasey Cooper on deck.
That seemed like a missed opportunity.
Still, Cooper led off the sixth with a walk. Then Carlee Wallace walked. After Jade Rhodes failed to get a bunt down, Madi Gipson cleaned up the mess with a single into the right-center gap. That allowed Cooper to score from second base.
&quot;I was just focusing on getting the ball on the ground,&quot; Gipson said. &quot;I was ecstatic.&quot;
The next hitter, Shea, grounded out to shortstop as pinch runner Bree Fornis scored from third base. That moved Auburn ahead 2-1 heading into the seventh inning.
Walters dispatched the Bulldogs in order during that final inning to end the game. The senior&apos;s afternoon? Three innings pitched, zero hits allowed, zero runs allowed.
&quot;I really like high-pressure situations,&quot; Walters said. &quot;That&apos;s what I really feed off of.&quot;
Auburn (45-5, 14-4) resumes play next weekend with a series at Tennessee.

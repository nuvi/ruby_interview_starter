April 25, 2016 1:00 AM Frumpy Middle-Aged Mom: 5 tips on Mother&apos;s Day flowers By MARLA JO FISHER The Orange County Register Order Reprint of this Story 
Curious about how the major online florists rate? For its May 2016 issue, just in time for Mother&apos;s Day, Consumer Reports published its findings on ordering flowers online. 
1. In the Consumer Reports survey, FTD&apos;s roses got the highest marks for appearance and freshness, followed by 1-800-Flowers and ProFlowers. The magazine ordered flowers just before Valentine&apos;s Day and asked staff to evaluate them. 
2. Before you order online, go back to the florist websites a few times, which can trigger price cuts and coupons the more often you click. 
3. Send your flowers a few days before the big day. Not only will it be likely to be delivered on time, but you might save on delivery charges that escalate because of demand pricing. 
4. Ask the recipient about the flowers, and, if they were substandard, get a picture to send to the company with your complaint. All three companies guarantee their flowers will last seven days, and offer a free replacement or refund. 
5. Don&apos;t forget to factor shipping and taxes into your total cost. CR&apos;s shipping fees ranged from $12.99 to $18.99 for a dozen roses. 
Thanks, Consumer Reports! Personally, I call a local florist direct in the town I&apos;m sending to and order instead of using a big company. It&apos;s not hard nowadays to find well-respected florists, and you&apos;ll be more likely to get exactly what you want, without paying a middle man. 
Marla Jo Fisher was a workaholic before she adopted two foster kids several years ago. Now she juggles work and single parenting, while being exhorted from everywhere to be thinner, smarter, sexier, healthier, more frugal, a better mom, better dressed and a tidier housekeeper.

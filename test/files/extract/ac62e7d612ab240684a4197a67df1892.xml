The cowboy rode away nearly two years ago, but you would have never known it listening to his strong and distinctly country voice on Friday.
Readers&apos; Poll: The 10 Best George Strait Songs
After a long-celebrated final tour, George Strait returned to the stage last night for the first time since June 2014, the first of a series of shows in Las Vegas, and the King of Country didn&apos;t miss a beat.
&quot;It&apos;s so good to be back,&quot; Strait told the sold-out crowd at the recently opened T-Mobile Arena. &quot;I miss all y&apos;all. I&apos;ve been looking forward to this for a long, long time.&quot;
To be fair, Strait never said that he was done playing shows in 2014, only that he was done &quot;touring&quot; at the time.
And he looked right at home back in the spotlight, as he breezed through a two-hour set of 33 songs, including hits like &quot;Run,&quot; &quot;The Chair&quot; and &quot;All My Ex&apos;s Live in Texas.&quot; But the show was far from a greatest-hits retread, thanks to newer songs like &quot;Cold Beer Conversation&quot; and &quot;Goin&apos; Goin&apos; Gone.&quot;
Thirty-five years after his debut single &quot;Unwound&quot; hit radio, the King of Country remains the consummate entertainer. Even if that doesn&apos;t include mad gallops across his stage — in the round, as is his custom — or dynamic set pieces. For Strait, simplicity rules.
While most of the songs were from his own catalog, Strait also led the crowd through a tribute to the late Merle Haggard, performing &quot;Mama Tried,&quot; &quot;The Fightin&apos; Side of Me&quot; and &quot;My Life&apos;s Been Grand&quot; as a medley. Though celebratory, it added a touch of melancholy to an upbeat show.
&quot;It was such a sad day for all of us because he was such a huge influence on my and all the guys up here,&quot; Stait said of Haggard. &quot;It&apos;s so sad that we&apos;ll never be able to see Merle perform live again. His music will live on forever.&quot;
While his last touring show in Arlington, Texas , two years ago featured a slew of guests, his Vegas kickoff was all about Strait — and his fans. He satisfied the crowd with &quot;The Fireman&quot; and &quot;Amarillo by Morning,&quot; but also tossed in &quot;You Look So Good in Love&quot; for the diehards who have rarely seen him perform the 1983 ballad live.
The night began with Kacey Musgraves in the opening slot, walking to the stage with a mini horse. The visual wasn&apos;t lost on Strait.
&quot;We were very fortunate to have a great talent come along with us in Kacey Musgraves,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;I gotta get me one of those horses.&quot;
For the 20,000 in attendance, though, they got everything they wanted from Strait. And even after two years, it was well worth the wait.
Strait will return to the T-Mobile Arena for a second show tonight, with four more Vegas engagements slotted through the end of the year.

George is the utmost in entertainment. I&apos;ve never heard a bad song. He is just simply country and a great singer.

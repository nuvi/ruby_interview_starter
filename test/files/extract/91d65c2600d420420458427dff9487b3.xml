LOS ANGELES (AP) — Eric Clapton is recalling Prince as a true genius and the inspiration for Clapton&apos;s song &quot;Holy Mother.&quot;
In a Facebook post Saturday, the rock and blues musician told of a dark time in his life in the 1980s that was eased by discovering Prince through the 1984 movie &quot;Purple Rain.&quot;
&quot;I was out on the road in a massive downward spiral with drink and drugs, I saw Purple Rain in a cinema in Canada, I had no idea who he was, it was like a bolt of lightning!&quot; Clapton wrote. &quot;In the middle of my depression, and the dreadful state of the music culture at that time it gave me hope, he was like a light in the darkness.&quot;
Returning to his hotel room and &quot;surrounded by empty beer cans,&quot; he recounted, Clapton wrote the song filled with both pain and faith.
&quot;Holy Mother, where are you? Tonight I feel broken in two. I&apos;ve seen the stars fall from the sky. Holy mother, can&apos;t keep from crying,&quot; the song begins. It ends with, &quot;When my hands no longer play, my voice is still, I fade away. Holy mother, then I&apos;ll be lying in, safe within your arms.&quot;
On Facebook, Clapton wrote that he was &quot;so sad about the death of Prince,&quot; adding, &quot;I can&apos;t believe he&apos;s gone.&quot;
Prince, 57, was found dead Thursday in his suburban Minneapolis home, with the cause of death unknown.

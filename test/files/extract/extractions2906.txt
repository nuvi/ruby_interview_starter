April 25, 2016 OPOL, Misamis Oriental – A simple yet historic groundbreaking ceremony for the P500-million investment for the bulk water supply project in Opol was held last April 20 at the Lumayagan River in Barangay Tingalan.
AB Bulk Water Company, Inc., a new subsidiary of A Brown Company, Inc. (ABCI), will undertake the bulk water supply project in partnership with the local government of Opol under the Private-Public Partnership scheme.
ABCI Executive Chairman Dr. Walter Brown and President Robertino Pizarro led the groundbreaking ceremony.
“Mr. Pizarro and I are delighted to be able to participate in the first truly Private-Public venture, of huge importance — the development of water resources,” said Dr. Brown in a press statement. “We are very pleased with the level of cooperation of the local government of Opol. By working together, we would be able to improve the welfare of the local community and the province.”
Dr. Brown expressed hope that the project will be an example for other local communities. “Potable water is an essential and central ingredient in the life of any community, especially in light of the ongoing El Niño,” he said. “Let this groundbreaking be a reaffirmation of our commitment to seeing this project to completion.”
Meanwhile, Opol town mayor Max Seno expressed thanks to ABCI for its work in choosing Opol town as their partner in this latest endeavor. “The development of a bulk water project will trigger inclusive growth for the municipality,” he said.
A flagship project of Mayor Seno, the water system is expected to benefit some 25,000 residents of Opol and nearby areas like El Salvador City and Laguindingan, Misamis Oriental.
The landmark event was attended by municipal officials of Opol led by Mayor Seno, Vice Mayor Thatsie Ortigosa, members of the Sangguniang Bayan, and bank representatives. Also on hand were barangay officials from Opol poblacion, Awang, Bagocboc, and host barangay Tingalan.

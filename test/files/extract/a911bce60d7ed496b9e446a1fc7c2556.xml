Letter: Public money changed things Posted: April 25, 2016 - 12:02am 
During very old times, democracy was tried and found a wonderful system of governing — for about 150 years — and then found to be a real problem as voters discovered their ability to have the public money sent to them. 
Well, that seems to be where we are. In the late 1800s in the U.S., Woodrow Wilson started a movement to rewrite our Constitution. He had some success, as he started the progressive movement. 
Lyndon Johnson gave this a jump start, which with the moral degeneration of our nation, looks us in the face today. During a “debate” between presidential contenders, one individual is credited with a big “gaffe.” I contend he was right on track. 
Please take some time and read a bit of the writings of Karl Marx and his helper. Together they developed The Communist Manifesto. Then look at a couple of recent writings — “Rules For Radicals” by Saul Alinsky and “The Cloward-Pivin Strategy.” 
Our present four branches of government (executive, congressional, judicial and regulatory) have us on a real road!

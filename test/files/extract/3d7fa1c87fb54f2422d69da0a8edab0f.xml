Fans of Anna Kendrick’s self-deprecating humor and witty Twitter account won’t have to wait too long to read the comic-actress’ forthcoming essay collection, Scrappy Little Nobody . The book will be published on Nov. 15 by Touchstone, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster. The Pitch Perfect star announced the book title and release date on Twitter Monday. I have a book!! Why would anyone let me do this!? Go to https://t.co/MGBxhY9GIF to pre-order! #ScrappyLittleNobody pic.twitter.com/O6HlEUUm6c

Scrappy Little Nobody will cover amusing anecdotes from Kendrick’s life, from her New England upbringing to eventually starring in films like Up in the Air . Kedrick joins a line of celebrities who have gotten book deals to write funny essay collections in recent years. 
“I’m excited to publish my first book,” Kendrick said in a release, “and because I get uncomfortable when people have high expectations, I’d like to use this opportunity to showcase my ineptitude, pettiness, and the frequency with which I embarrass myself. And while many of my female inspirations who have become authors are incredibly well-educated and accomplished comedy writers, I’m very, very funny on Twitter, according to BuzzFeed and my mom, so I feel like this is a great idea. Quick question: are run-on sentences still frowned upon? Wait, is ending a sentence with a preposition still frowned upon? I mean, upon frowned? Dammit!”

Posted Apr. 24, 2016 at 9:53 PM Updated at 11:38 PM Posted Apr 24, 2016 at 9:53 PM Updated at 11:38 PM Disney continues a blockbuster quarter at the box office, with The Jungle Book taking the top spot this weekend over The Huntsman: Winter&apos;s War. The live-action take on the Rudyard Kipling novel brought in $60.8 million in its second weekend, tripling The Huntsman &apos;s meager $20 million, according to Box Office Mojo . Not only did The Huntsman fail to topple the Disney film, but it only brought in about a third of what its predecessor, Snow White and the Huntsman , earned in its opening weekend in 2012. Add shows to your Watchlist now Disney&apos;s Zootopia also performed well, dropping to No. 4 with $6.6 million in its eighth week in theaters, behind Barber Shop: The Next Cut , with $10.8 milion. Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice dipped to No. 6 with $5.5 million. The superhero epic was topped by Melissa McCarthy &apos;s The Boss , which dropped two spots to No. 5 with almost $6.1 million. The bottom half of the chart also holds familiar titles. Criminal ($3.1 million) and My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 ($2.1 million) landed at No. 7 and No. 8 respectively. The week&apos;s other new release, Compadres , ranked at No. 9 with $1.4 million, just beating out Eye in the Sky , which finished in 10th place with $ 1.2 million. What did you go see this weekend?

The 52-year-old Westside man who died Sunday morning as he was helping renovate a vacant warehouse unit at 4314 St. Augustine Road has been identified by the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office. 
Michael Shawn Fraser of Du-Clay Road was died at UF Health Jacksonville after he fell 10 feet when wooden shelving collapsed on him, according to the Sheriff’s Office. 
The police report states that Fraser and a cousin were inside demolishing the large wooden structure when it occurred. 
Fraser was standing on the mezzanine deck and trying to take down the wooden boards when they fell, and he went with them, the police report said. He hit his head on the concrete and began bleeding profusely as his cousin called 911. 
The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has been notified, police said.

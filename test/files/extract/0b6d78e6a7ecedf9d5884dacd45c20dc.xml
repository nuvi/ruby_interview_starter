Posted Apr. 25, 2016 @ 12:36 pm By Loretta LaRoche Posted Apr. 25, 2016 @ 12:36 pm » Social News The other day I went shopping for some underwear in a local store. As I was checking out, the clerk asked me if I wanted a rewards card. She said every time I bought six pairs, I would get one free. Now I don’t know about you but I don’t wear out my underwear that soon to want to carry around another rewards card. I already have access to a number of rewards cards for restaurants, oil changes, cosmetics and who knows what else. My wallet is starting to weigh more than me! How about just reducing the amount you’re charging me? That would be a great reward. I have a lot of pet peeves that get me ranting about the absurdities that have added to the complexity of life. The good news is that a lot of it is laughable. Every time I try to open a jar, I wonder why it has to be so difficult. I am totally in sync with protecting children from getting into what could be a dangerous substance. But does everything have to be triple wrapped and have tops that need a jackhammer to open them. I tried to open a jar of pickles the other day and came very close to throwing it against the wall. What about the commercials for prescription drugs? First they show a bunch of happy people laughing, twirling and seemingly in good health as a result of the drug. Then they spend twice as much time telling you what could happen to you if you take it. The amount of side effects are insane — blood clots, facial hair, trouble walking, possible blindness, pimples and, if that’s not enough, death. Doesn’t that make you want to beg your doctor for a prescription? How about all the reality shows about women from different states? I’ve watched a few just to see what they’re all about. They share a constant stream of mundane dialogue, have screaming fits, and prance around looking like plastic surgery is their new best friend. A couple of them had lips that looked like small tires. I grew up in what could have been a great reality show. An Italian family yelling one minute, laughing the next and always cooking something to eat in-between. My greatest frustration is “passwords.” Do I really need a password for everything I do? I tried to order some coffee last night and “it” didn’t recognize my e-mail or my password. So, I had to change it, but not until they sent me a form to get a new one. UGH! I’m not trying to get into the White House, just buying some coffee. What every happened to simplicity and common sense. It’s buried somewhere and you’re going to need a password to get to it. — Author, humorist, PBS star and Fortune 500 trainer Loretta LaRoche lives in Plymouth, Massachusetts.

Industrial Scientific Introduces the Ventis™ Pro Series Multi-Gas Monitors Monday, 25 April 2016 ( 37 minutes ago ) The Ventis™ Pro4 and Pro5 personal gas monitors set a new standard for size and ease of use. PITTSBURGH, PA (PRWEB) April 25, 2016 Industrial Scientific, the global leader in gas detection, today introduced the Ventis™ Pro Series Multi-Gas Monitors. Small, rugged, and highly configurable, the Ventis Pro Series is backed by the industry’s only Guaranteed for Life™ warranty and offers a wide range of sensor options to detect up to five gases. The Ventis™ Pro4 is compatible with four of the following sensors: LEL/CH4, O2, CO, CO/H2 Low, H2S, SO2, NO2, or HCN making it ideal for industries such as fire service, steel, and construction. The Ventis™ Pro5 detects up to five gases including any covered by the Pro4 in addition to NH3, CO2/hydrocarbon IR, CO2/CH4 IR, and CO/H2S. Industries such as oil and gas, petrochemical, power generation, metal and coal mining, gas utilities, and refrigeration, which typically need a larger five-gas instrument, can easily transition to the smaller, lighter Ventis Pro5. Both the Ventis Pro4 and Pro5 are equipped with a variety of new safety features that raise the bar on worker safety.· iAssign™ Technology tracks users and sites in real-time using Near Field Communication (NFC) to help safety managers identify and address jobsite gas hazards and improve asset management. · A dedicated panic button and man-down alarm help to alert nearby workers when someone is in distress or has lost consciousness. · Acknowledgeable gas alerts let users know when they are in the presence of gas below the low alarm level enabling them to take safety precautions while continuing to work. · Alarm action messages provide written instructions during low and high alarm events, helping workers to react appropriately. In addition to being the most advanced multi-gas monitors on the market, the Ventis Pro Series is extremely rugged. It comes with a Guaranteed for Life warranty and is IP68 rated, meaning the instruments have the highest level of protection against dust ingress and can withstand being submerged in water at a depth of 1.5 meters for one hour. “The Ventis Pro Series sets a new standard for safety, usability, and utility in a wearable instrument,” said Justin McElhattan, President and CEO. “It is the ideal monitor to have by your side when you want it least and when you need it most.” For more information on the Ventis Pro Series, visit http://www.indsci.com/ventispro.

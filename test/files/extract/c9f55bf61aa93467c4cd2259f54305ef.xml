May Street Update: Man charged with 2 murders and robbery Posted on Monday 25 April 2016 Detectives have charged a man with murder and robbery, after the deaths of two men in Hull. The bodies of Daniel Hatfield, 52, and Matthew Higgins, 49, were found in a back garden on May Street last Friday night. 38 year old Phillip Simmons is due to appear at Hull Magistrates Court later today. In a statement, Humberside Police said: &quot;The men were discovered in the rear garden following a call from the public at 6.04pm on Friday 22 April. 
&quot;The men have been identified as Hull men, 52-year-old Daniel Hatfield and 49-year-old Matthew Higgins. Specialist officers have been deployed to support their families. 

Detective Superintendent Matt Hutchinson from Major Crime added: 


“The two victims in this case died have sustained serious injuries&quot; 
&quot;It is important to re-iterate that these murders are being treated as an isolated incident, however high visibility patrols will continue in the area to provide additional reassure to the local community.”

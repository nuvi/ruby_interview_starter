The family of Tamir Rice is set to receive $6million from the city of Cleveland after lawyers settled a wrongful death suit over the 12-year-old&apos;s fatal shooting by a white police officer.
Mother Samaria Rice is set to receive $250,000, sister Tajai Rice will also be given $250,000, while $5.5million will be paid directly to the estate of Tamir Rice.
An order filed in U.S. District Court in Cleveland on Monday says the city will pay out $3 million this year and $3 million the next.
Tamir Rice&apos;s family are set to receive $6million from the city of Cleveland after attorneys agreed to settle a wrongful death suit brought over the 12-year-old&apos;s 2014 shooting by a while police officer
The wrongful death suit claimed officers and dispatchers who were involved in Tamir&apos;s 2014 shooting acted recklessly when dealing with the youngster, who was gunned down while playing with a toy gun close to his family home.
The lawsuit was filed two weeks after his death, but it was not until March this year that both parties agreed to enter settlement talks.
Subodh Chandra, attorney for the Rice family, told Fox 8 : &apos;The City of Cleveland has agreed to payment of $6million to settle the federal civil-rights lawsuit involving the tragic death of Tamir Rice.

Volunteer firefighter charged with ARSON after &apos;starting... &apos;Although historic in financial terms, no amount of money can adequately compensate for the loss of a life. Tamir was 12 years old when police shot and killed him—a young boy with his entire life ahead of him, full of potential and promise.
&apos;In a situation such as this, there is no such thing as closure or justice. Nothing will bring Tamir back.
&apos;His unnecessary and premature death leave a gaping hole for those who knew and loved him that can never be filled.
Samaria Rice, Tamir&apos;s mother (pictured in 2015), will receive $250,000 as part of the deal, while another $5.5million will be paid directly to her son&apos;s estate
Tajai Rice, Tamir&apos;s sister (pictured center on the Today show) will also receive $250,000. The money will be paid in two lumps sums of $3million this year and next year
&apos;Regrettably, Tamir’s death is not an isolated event. The problem of police violence, especially in communities of color, is a crisis plaguing our nation.
&apos;It is the Rice family&apos;s sincere hope that Tamir’s death will stimulate a movement for genuine change in our society and our nation’s policing so that no family ever has to suffer a tragedy such as this again.&apos;
Under the terms of the settlement, neither the city nor any of the defendants admit wrongdoing in the boy&apos;s death.
Officer Timothy Loehmann fatally shot Tamir in 2014 after he was called to reports of a man waving a gun and pointing it at people
The settlement is one of the largest reached in recent years amid a spate of wrongful death claims against major city police forces.
In September last year Baltimore agreed to pay $6.4 million to the family of Freddie Gray who died in police custody from a spine injury.
In July of the same year New York City agreed to a $5.9million settlement over the death of Eric Garner who also died in police custody after he was filmed being placed in a chokehold.
Tamir was shot to death close to his family home in Cleveland in November 2014 while playing outside with a non-lethal pellet gun.
Police had received a call from a man drinking at a bus stop nearby who told call-takers that there was a boy waving a gun around and pointing it at people.
The man added that the gun was unlikely to be real and the person involved was a juvenile, but the call-taker never passed that information to dispatchers.
Instead junior patrolman Timothy Loehmann, 26, and trainer Frank Garmback, 46, were sent to a high-priority call of a man waving a weapon.
After arriving at the scene, Loehmann said he opened fire after he saw the boy reach for what he believed to be a deadly weapon.
The gun had its tell-tale orange tip removed, which officers often rely on while judging weather a weapon is real.
Video of Tamir&apos;s death shows a police cruiser skidding to a stop and Loehmann firing within two seconds of opening the car door.
Tamir wasn&apos;t given first aid until about four minutes later, when an FBI agent trained as a paramedic arrived. The boy died the next day.
A grand jury declined to bring charges against the officers, branding the incident a &apos;perfect storm of human error&apos;, but found no crime had taken place. A federal civil rights investigation is pending.
CCTV of the shooting shows Loehmann shot Tamir (pictured with the pellet gun) within two seconds of arriving on the scene, and that the boy was not given first aid until four minutes after being shot
The shooting raised questions about how police treat black people, spurred protests around Cleveland and helped spark the creation of a state police standards board to lay out rules about use of deadly force in law enforcement.
Tamir&apos;s mother, Samaria Rice, had alleged that police failed to immediately provide first aid for her son and caused intentional infliction of emotional distress in how they treated her and her daughter after the shooting.
The officers had asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit. Loehmann&apos;s attorney has said he bears a heavy burden and must live with what happened.
The settlement comes two years after the city settled another lawsuit connected to the killings of two unarmed black people in a 137-shot barrage of police gunfire at the end of a 2012 car chase.
Cleveland settled a lawsuit brought by the victims&apos; families for a total of $3 million.

he was pointing a gun at people - and even approached the police with his gun. that it was a toy was irrelevant in that it *looked* real because he&apos;d removed the orange tip.

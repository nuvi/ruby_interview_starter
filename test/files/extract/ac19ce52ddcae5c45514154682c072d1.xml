Former UNLV basketball coach Dave Rice has been hired as an assistant at rival Nevada, according to multiple reports. 
The 47-year-old Rice, a member of the Runnin&apos; Rebels&apos; 1990 national championship team, was let go at UNLV in January during the middle of his fifth season. 
He was 98-54 as UNLV&apos;s head coach, leaving Las Vegas with the third-most wins in program history. 
UNLV&apos;s board of regents voted 12-1 last week to approve a five-year, $3.75 million deal for Marvin Menzies as the school&apos;s new head coach. Dave Rice, who was dismissed by UNLV in January, reportedly will be joining Nevada&apos;s coaching staff. Ethan Miller/Getty Images 
UNLV thought it had a replacement for Rice when it hired former Arkansas-Little Rock coach Chris Beard, but his tenure didn&apos;t last long -- he was gone less than a week after having his contract approved, bolting for Texas Tech, where he had been an assistant for 10 years. 
Menzies, 54, spent the past nine seasons at New Mexico State, leading the Aggies to four straight WAC tournament titles and NCAA tournament berths from 2012 to &apos;15. New Mexico State also played in the NCAA tournament in 2010.

During a private service for the beloved singer over the weekend, Prince’s brother-in-law Maurice Phillips said that he was awake for six days before he died, the Daily Mail reported Monday. (RELATED: PRINCE — DEAD AT 57) 
“I was with him just last weekend,” Phillips said. “He worked 154 hours straight.” 
Phillips is married to Prince’s sister Tyka Nelson, and said Prince was “a good brother-in-law.” 
Phillips would not say “what Prince had been working on in the days before he was died, nor give details of what was going on at the service,” the Mail reports. 
Prince was found dead in an elevator in Minnesota home last Thursday, just days after he was reportedly treated for a drug overdose at an Illinois hospital. (RELATED: Prince Treated For Drug Overdose Days Before His Death: Report)

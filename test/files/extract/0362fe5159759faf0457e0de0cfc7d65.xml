Edit 
Frank is a man who sees the world in pure black and white terms and believes that the only way to keep the streets safe is to kill criminals so they don&apos;t harm innocents again. When his wife, son, and daughter were murdered, a devastated Frank turned into a violent almost sociopathic individual, determined to kill every single criminal who had a hand in his family&apos;s death. When dealing with criminals, he is brutal, cold, and efficient. Despite this though, Frank greatly values the lives of innocents, and will do his absolute best to make sure that civilians are not harmed, as shown when he went to the hospital looking for Grotto and made sure not to harm any patients or Karen Page. Frank upholds an honor code of &quot;One Shot, One Kill&quot;, getting the job done as quickly as possible, whilst trying to avoid any collateral damage. He also avoided killing Daredevil, and when presented with the chance to kill him, Frank simply resorted to knocking him out. Despite his cold and ruthless demeanor, beneath it all, Frank is a man who strongly and deeply misses his beloved family, and wishes only to make up for what he sees as his inability to protect them. Frank also appears to believe in returning favors, since him helping Daredevil defeat the Hand ninjas can be seen as him repaying the vigilante for rescuing him from torture at the hands of the Kitchen Irish. Abilities Master Hand-To-Hand Combatant: Frank is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant. Master Marksman: Frank is a highly skilled marksman. Expert Tactician: Frank is a highly skilled tactician.

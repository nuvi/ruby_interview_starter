Learning Resources Pearson and Mathspace Partner To Improve Mathematical Reasoning Skills Pearson’s partnership brings a new feature to MyMathLab and MyStatLab that offers students feedback and support while solving math problems. By Sri Ravipati 04/25/16 In an effort to help college and university students improve their mathematical reasoning skills, Pearson has partnered with Mathspace to incorporate the company’s adaptive technology in the former’s MyMathLab and MyStatLab products. The result: a new Workspace Assignments feature for MyMathLab and MyStatLab that provides students with feedback and guidance as they solve math problems. Mathspace collects data at multiple points while a student works on a problem, adjusting to the unique solution path each learner takes and allowing students to show their mathematical reasoning while problem-solving. Workspace Assignments uses that technology to assess every exercise, providing students with feedback at every step of the problem. The program offers hints, video and next step suggestions to provide support. Students can access the program from desktops, laptops and mobile devices, as well as use a stylus or their fingertip to work through the exercises. Additionally, instructors can see all of the steps through their MyLab gradebook. “By providing feedback and reinforcement at each step along the path toward a solution, Mathspace helps students build both confidence and competence in their math skills while providing educators with valuable insights that can be used to tailor instruction around students’ problem areas,” said Paul Corey, managing director for higher education courseware at Pearson, in a prepared statement. The integration of Workspace Assignments within MyLab technologies will be available for back-to-school 2016. Additional information can be found on the Pearson

Our Correspondent KOHIMA, APRIL 25 
The Nagaland State Disability Forum (NSDF) on Monday came out strongly voicing their right to live as equal citizens, and not on the fringes of the society completely deprived of their rights and dignity, facing exclusion and discrimination from society as a whole. Despite the existence of various laws, guidelines and court orders that have been notified from time to time to ensure equal rights and full participation of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), the forum members lamented that the Nagaland government has consistently failed this section of its citizens through the years. “There is gross violation of the rights of persons with disability in all areas of life, yet our state government remains apathetic and tragically, also ignorant of the laws and the issue in general…. Today we are saying that this is no longer acceptable,” says Diethono Nakhro, Disability Advocate and advisor to NSDF. Highlighting the issues and the situation that PWDs are constantly facing in the state, during a press meet held in the office of the Kohima Press Club here today, Nakhro made it clear that the forum is speaking up not in expectance of charitable handouts but because it is their right to have equal opportunities and choices as everyone else. She said the Nagasare compassionate people but when it comes to disability matter, the people are still living in the “dark ages”. “There is a general unawareness in our society,” she stated, pointing out that persons with disabilities being regarded as equal citizens is glaringly missing, and instead they are regarded with pity without inclusivity She remarked that the Persons with Disabilities Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation Act (PWD Act) came into being in India in 1995, and in 2007, India ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). Since then, she said the process of getting a stronger disability rights legislation based on the UN Convention has been underway and a new bill is currently awaiting passage by the Parliament. “Despite the existence of the law (PWD Act 1995), however imperfect, the state government has completely and consistently failed to implement it properly, thus failing the differently abled community,” Nakhro said. Even the Social Welfare department, the state’s nodal agency concerned, is said to be ignorant of the existing laws that protect the rights of PWDs, and they are expected to ensure social security to the marginalized community. While acknowledging that some NGOs are sincerely doing what they can for the cause of PWDs, she feels there is still a wide gap and there is little or no participation or representation of persons with disability(ies) in the social sphere. Nakhrosaid that as per the Census 2011, there are 29,631 people with various disabilities in Nagaland, and even while this is still a conservative estimation, this large section continues to live in a situation where they are not able to participate fully in the society all because of lack of accessibility, a barrier-free environment which is nil in the state. Accessibility, one of the foremost factors that needs to be looked into, she pointed, is absent in all the public offices including the state’s own Civil Secretariat. The NSDF members present at the press meet also shared their concerns on inclusive education system, stating that a majority of children with disabilities and special needs do not receive any formal education despite an inclusive education programme in existence. They stressed on the need to strictly implement inclusive education in the state’s education system at all levels. They also expressed dismay that funds meant for education of PWDs are being misappropriated and towards this, they asserted that they want answers particularly on the misappropriation of Inclusive Education for the Disabled at Secondary Stage (IEDSS) funds under the School Education department amounting to Rs.12 crore. “Funds are coming but where are they going? Even when there is evidence of embezzlement, what is being done about it?” they asked. The NSDF is also of the view that the Disability Pension scheme needs to be reviewed as currently, a pension amount of a meagre Rs.200 per month is being given to beneficiaries, the lowest in the country. As per the Social Welfare department(through RTI), only 1833 out of the 29,631 PwDs registered are availing disability pension, however even this “unacceptable amount” is not disbursed to the few beneficiaries in time, they stated. It is also reported that out of the total annual pension amount of Rs.2400, Rs.100 is being deducted for each beneficiary by the department on grounds of office maintenance. The forum alleged that in some small entitlements that are given to PWDs, the beneficiaries are categorized under wrong disability while there is no information on scholarships meant for students with disabilities. Privileges, however small, they said, are sanctioned to PWDs as they are considered vulnerable and need social security benefits, but in Nagaland these are in a huge mess and PWDs are left suffering instead of benefitting from them. They also called for reviewing and streamlining of Disability Certificate issuance process by the health department, as well as the setting up of office of the state Commissioner for PWDs and appointment of a qualified person with proper and special knowledge and experience in disability matters. “Some states have a separate department for PWDs but we don’t even have a proper office set up of the Disability Commissioner,” they pointed out. Underscoring the need for inclusion of PWDs in various programs and schemes/projects that involves the disability sector, the forum stated that it has to be made aware that representation of PWDs is implemented in such programmes even at the Central level. Towards this, they mentioned the appointment of a committee for Accessible India Campaign in Kohima which did not have such representation despite the inclusion of the Disability Commissioner, who is not a PWD. It is also a shameful fact and a serious concern that there is not a single disability rehabilitation centre in the entire state, Nakhro has pointed out. Mentioning that whilerehabilitation centres are supposed to be set up in every district, she said the lone District Disability Rehabilitation Centre (DDRC) set up in Dimapur a few years ago is now defunct due to lack of funds. She stated that due to lack of facilities to provide adequate care particularly for severely disabled in the state, PWDs are either abandoned, neglected and discriminated. It was learnt that while the state does not have enough specialists to cater to the needs of PWDs, the few that were there have been posted to hospitals that are not relevant to their field after the DDRC shut down and some have started private clinics but unfortunately, only those who can afford the rates can avail the services. One of the NSDF executives shared her experience of applying for a job interview in a government department which advertised a 3% reservation for PWDs for the particular post. She said when she appeared for the interview, the panel members just looked at her, her documents, asked her name and dismissed her. “Though we have a disability, by accepting our limitations, we also want to be able to participate in the society and work for a living,” she said. Towards this, the NSDF emphasized on the implementation of 3% reservation for PWDs in government jobs strictly in the state as per the PWD Act 1995 and the Supreme Court order of 2013. “Our government has to this point, seriously failed the disabled community. We are not asking for charity, we are asking for our rights to be given as under the law,” one of the members stated. NSDF members from Kohima, Dimapur, Mokokchung and Chumukedima attended the press meet. They included NSDF president KezhaletoZecho, vice president HukheviYeptho, secretary Ashe H Kiba, joint secretary Moa Akum, and members Fatima Kera and Catherine. Related posts:

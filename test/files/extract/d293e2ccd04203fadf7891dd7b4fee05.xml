Discovery Channel is in production on a new TV series, &quot;Blue Collar Backers,&quot; Business Insider has learned exclusively. 
It features a group of millionaire investors who put both cash and sweat equity into new businesses. 
These sharks aren&apos;t afraid to face a competitive market for business investments and loans with both their checkbooks and by rolling up their sleeves and getting grimy. Old-school, tried-and-true business techniques meet today&apos;s marketplace. 
On each episode of &quot;Blue Collar Backers,&quot; which premieres May 18 at 10 p.m. ET, the panel of successful businesspeople across various fields and trades will share the lessons they&apos;ve learned over their careers with budding entrepreneurs. They&apos;ll then provide the funds, time, and hard work to help make businesses a success — no matter how messy it gets. 
Leftfield Pictures, the production company behind &quot;Pawn Stars,&quot; is producing the show for Discovery Channel.

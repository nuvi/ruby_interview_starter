 28 AM EDT Redstone Community Spring Event May 1st, 2016 
Calgary, Alberta - The northeast Calgary community of Redstone’s Spring Event is an ideal time to find out about building with Broadview Homes . The event will run from 12:00 noon – 4:00 pm on Sunday, May 1st, 2016 at Broadview Homes’ Redstone show homes located at 174 &amp; 178 Redstone Common NE and 134 Redstone Park NE. 
“This four-hour event will be an exciting time for prospective families to check out this growing NE community as a future home community, plus get the opportunity to win a $500 Shell gift card,” noted Dmitri Voyevoda Broadview Homes Area Manager, who considers Redstone a community where families often turn to find a home that fits what they are looking for. 
Among the highlights of the event, there will be: 
Orange balloons to help guide visitors through the community to all three show home parades. 
Radio Stations will be outside (weather permitting). 
Face painting, balloons and glitter tattoos will also be outside, or if the weather doesn’t permit, inside the show homes. 
There will be a Qualico tent where people can enter the Gas Card draw electronically on iPads and the winner will be chosen on Monday May 2nd. 
According to the spokesperson, besides the fun and games, the event was designed to help families learn more about building a new home suited for their needs in Redstone. 
With Redstone being one of the fastest growing communities in Calgary, this event is an ideal time to see everything that this community has to offer. Broadview’s home designs accommodates all types of families, especially ones with special design requests like multi-generational families, with the customization of their floorplans to suit the family’s needs.

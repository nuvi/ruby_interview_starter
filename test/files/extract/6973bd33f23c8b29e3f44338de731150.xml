Officials in Vermont, New Hampshire and New York are expanding their efforts to find out how much of a potentially toxic chemical ended up in drinking water, from private wells to public water systems.
Factories for decades used the chemical, perfluorooctanoic acid or PFOA, as a plastic coating and to make consumer products such as Teflon nonstick pans, waterproof jackets and pizza boxes.
Former large manufacturers or users of PFOA, including 3M Co. MMM, -0.44% and DuPont Co. DD, -0.82% agreed in 2006 to phase out PFOA production and use by December 2015.
Public concern over PFOA has spread through upstate New York and New England since August 2014, when a resident of Hoosick Falls, N.Y., near the Vermont border, tested his drinking water and found high levels of the acid. The man was concerned because his father, a former employee of the town’s plastics plant that used PFOA, died of cancer.

Earlier this month, roughly 200 people crowded into a high school auditorium in Litchfield, N.H., to hear from New Hampshire environmental officials. Attendees voiced concerns about PFOA’s possible effects on children, pets and garden produce.
Shawn Dalton, a retired 64-year-old, told the group that the drinking water from his home well tested positive for PFOA in March. “To me, the biggest problem is that nobody knows anything, and in a way we’re going to be the guinea pigs,” he said.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has yet to declare PFOA harmful to humans. “EPA has not yet made a determination as to whether PFOA poses an unreasonable risk to the public, and there are no steps that EPA recommends that consumers take to reduce exposures to PFOA,” it said in a statement.

Win Sisters On Blu-Ray™ Featured People &apos;Fed Up&apos; With Public Having Sex in Barcelona A video has gone viral online of a man romping a woman who is sitting on a bench in a train station with her legs high up in the air, in the Spanish city. People &apos;fed up&apos; with sex in public in Barcelona 
Barcelona residents are &apos;&apos;fed up&apos;&apos; with people having sex in public. 
A video has gone viral online which shows a man romping with a woman, who is sitting on a bench in a train station with her legs high up in the air, in the Spanish city. 
A bemused commuter is seen walking past the couple, who take absolutely no notice as another group of teenagers giggle and point. 
But one unwitting bystander filmed the incident and a friend of the cameraman told Catalan daily El Periodico: &apos;&apos;We are fed up with these sorts of situations and that&apos;s why we&apos;ve decided to register a formal protest and go public with it.&apos;&apos; 
Transport company Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona is looking for the couple to fine them for anti-social behaviour.

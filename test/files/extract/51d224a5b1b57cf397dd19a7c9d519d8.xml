Collaborative talks are currently ongoing between the LMC and Spain’s top flight officials with minister of sports Dalung saying such talks would grow Nigerian Football. The LMC officials are hosting their Spanish counterpart with the aim of concluding talks between both parties in Abuja. Dalung disclosed this when he received the La Liga officials led by its president Javier Tebas alongside LMC boss Shehu Dikko and NFF president Amaju Pinnick at his office in Abuja on Monday. 
We don’t have details of what the talks are all about(once they are available we would let you know),but we hope all the talks would bring about better management of footballing activies in the country. 
what do you think are the main issues that should be disscused between both parties? Spread the love

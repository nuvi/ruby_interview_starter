Sweet victory: Boy manages to pay for his own adoption after setting up lemonade stall Sweet victory: Boy manages to pay for his own adoption after setting up lemonade stall A YOUNG boy abandoned by his mother is raising money for a very special cause – to pay for his own adoption. PUBLISHED: 19:54, Mon, Apr 25, 2016 | UPDATED: 19:57, Mon, Apr 25, 2016 WGNTV.COM Tristin Jacobson and Donnie Davis raise money for the adoption by selling lemonade 
Nine-year-old Tristin Jacobson was just five when he was left on the doorstep of a homeless shelter in Missouri, USA. 
Donnie Davis was contacted as a foster carer and has fallen in love with the little boy and has been keen to adopt him. Related articles Traumatised children will be fast tracked in adoption with new plan 
However, the family was unable to afford the costly legal fees to formally make Tristin a permanent member of their family so he took matters into his own hands. 
The enterprising youngster set about making lemonade and biscuits to raise funds to pay for his adoption before boosting the fund-raising efforts with a garage sale. 
Now the family is celebrating after the story went viral and they have raised $14,000 (£9,658) – almost three times their original goal of $5,000 (£3,449). 
Tristin’s goodies stall and garage sale generated $7,100 (£4,897) and a campaign they started on YouCaring.com called Tristin’s Adoption Fund raised a further $6,900 (£4,760). WGNTV.COM Tristin sells lemonade to a customer WGNTV.COM Tristin Jacobson and his new mother Donnie Davis 
A delighted Tristin said he was looking forward to being adopted at last. 
Referring to Mrs Davis, Tristin said: “She’s responsible taking care of me and I think she’s going to be a great mum.” WGNTV.COM The youngster also held a garage sale 
Mrs Davis was equally thrilled and said: “He’s already part of our family. 
“In mine and my husband’s hearts, he’s already our son.” 
Mrs Davis said the additional money will go towards funding Tristin’s college education. Related articles

New Bedford man grazed in the head by bullet during failed robbery Comment Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 11:12 AM Updated Apr 25, 2016 at 2:06 PM Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 11:12 AM Updated Apr 25, 2016 at 2:06 PM » Social News NEW BEDFORD — A 28-year-old New Bedford man suffered a non-life-threatening gunshot wound early Monday after an aborted robbery in the city&apos;s North End, police said. A gunshot grazed the victim in the head and he was transported to Rhode Island Hospital, according to Detective Capt. Steven Vicente, a spokesman for the New Bedford Police Department. Vicente described the gunshot wound as &quot;minor.&quot; The incident happened at about 2:15 a.m. in the area of Tallman Street and Acushnet Avenue, as the victim was walking home from a local drinking establishment with two friends, according to Vicente. Two men approached the victim and tried to rob him at gunpoint. The suspect and the victim struggled and the suspect fired two gunshots before fleeing in an unknown direction, Vicente said. One shot grazed the victim in the head and the other struck a nearby parked car. Police do not have descriptions of the two suspects and detectives are making arrangements to speak with the victim sometime on Monday, Vicente said. Anyone with information is asked to contact Detective Michael Carrier at 508-991-6300, ext. 79512, or leave an anonymous tip at 508-961-4584. — Curt Brown

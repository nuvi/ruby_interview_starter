Investors await decisions from Fed and Bank of Japan
Chinese stocks led most Asian markets lower Monday, due in part to worries about a wave of corporate defaults hitting the country&apos;s bond market.
The Shanghai Composite Index was recently off 0.7%, while the CSI 300, a benchmark that tracks large mainland blue chips, fell 1%. Industrial companies led declines.
Elsewhere in the region, investors were stepping back ahead of monetary decisions from both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan later this week. Japan&apos;s Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.8%, Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng Index was off 0.6% and South Korea&apos;s Kospi lost 0.1%. Australia and New Zealand markets are closed for a holiday.
The Fed isn&apos;t expected to raise interest rates when it announces its April monetary decision. However, in Japan, traders are speculating about some form of easing from the BOJ. &quot;Prices [for Asian shares] have probably moved up too fast over the last couple of weeks,&quot; said Sean Darby, chief global equity strategist at Jefferies, adding that he expects &quot;flattish trading&quot; ahead of the two decisions.
China&apos;s domestic share market has also been preoccupied with worries about bond defaults from state-owned enterprises, including Baoding Tianwei Group. Local investors are also taking money out of equities to chase a rally in mainland commodities futures, according to analysts. Outstanding margin debt, or money local investors take out from brokerages to buy stocks, has dropped to about 872.2 billion yuan ($134.1 billion), the lowest level in over a month.
The Shanghai Composite Index is down 17% year-to-date.
&quot;The rising rates in corporate bonds [are] a warning sign to the equity market,&quot; says Shen Zhengyang, an analyst at Northeast Securities. &quot;If investors are less interested in bonds, which guarantee yields, they will be much less interested in stocks given [a] stronger need for risk aversion.&quot;
Chinese corporate defaults also have ripple effects because many Chinese companies have lent to each other. As one firm goes bust, another company&apos;s cash position is affected. &quot;So many companies in the A-share market have poor working capital or liquidity problems,&quot; says Jefferies&apos; Mr. Darby, referring to firms trading on the mainland. Still, he says markets will trade in a &quot;decent range&quot; given that China&apos;s central bank will likely adjust liquidity in the financial market in the short term, boosting trading sentiment.
In Japan, Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management, said he thinks Japan will increase its purchases of exchange-traded funds, while also introducing negative interest rates for some bank-loan programs. &quot;I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll do them, but I&apos;m not sure, for instance, how [many] more ETFs they are going to buy,&quot; he says.
The Japanese yen , considered a haven, was recently strengthening to Yen111.11 to one U.S. dollar. A stronger local currency decreases the competitiveness of Japanese exporters. The currency reached as weak as Yen111.90 to one U.S. dollar earlier.

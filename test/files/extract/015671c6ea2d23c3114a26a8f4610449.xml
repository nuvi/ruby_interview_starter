Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 12:01 AM Updated at 2:01 AM Posted Apr 25, 2016 at 12:01 AM Updated at 2:01 AM Valar Morghulis. All men must die -- but that doesn&apos;t mean they can&apos;t come back. One question has haunted Game of Thrones fans since Jon Snow ( Kit Harington ) appeared to be fatally stabbed by his fellow crows in the Season 5 finale: Is the Lord Commander really dead? There were many theories about how Jon might return, ranging from the predictable (Melisandre brings him back) to the ridiculous (he becomes the new Night&apos;s King). Keep reading below to find out what actually happened to our favorite bastard. (Spoilers ahead, obviously.) (via) The season premiere opened with Davos ( Liam Cunningham ) finding Jon Snow&apos;s dead body left outside in the snow of Castle Black. However, it wasn&apos;t until the end of the episode that Melisandre ( Carice van Houten ) used her witchcraft powers -- but we still don&apos;t know to what end. The Red Woman stripped down and instantly aged before our eyes before the closing credits rolled. Fans will have to wait at least another week to find out if she&apos;s simply giving up on life, or has somehow transferred her life force to allow Jon to live. What did you think of Jon&apos;s (maybe) return? Was it everything you hoped for or a mere mummer&apos;s farce? Game of Thrones airs Sundays at 9/8c on HBO. Other Links From TVGuide.com

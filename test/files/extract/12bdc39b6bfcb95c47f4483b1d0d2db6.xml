Beyonce shows business savvy in &quot;Lemonade&quot; rollout 
Given the veil of secrecy that usually surrounds releases by both Beyonce and Tidal, it is unclear if this was always the plan or if it was a move to mollify fans who complained online about the exclusivity. The hashtag #BuyLemonadeoniTunes quickly took over Twitter Monday morning. Kanye West, Tidal hit with class action lawsuit over &quot;The Life of Pablo&quot; release 
Tidal still has some hold over the hot-topic release, though, as the subscription service remains the only place to stream &quot;Lemonade&quot; -- a status that apparently won&apos;t be changing. So if listeners aren&apos;t interested in actually purchasing the album, they&apos;ll have to sign up for Tidal, as Spotify and Apple Music streams aren&apos;t in the cards, apparently. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

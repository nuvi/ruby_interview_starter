PHILADELPHIA—Not long after putting a final pin in his presidential plans in the Rose Garden last October, Vice President Joe Biden started talking to staff about a different mission for 2016: helping put his beloved Senate back into Democratic hands. Within weeks, incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) was at the Naval Observatory for breakfast, talking over the details. Not long after, he returned with Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chair Jon Tester (D-Mont.) for a 90-minute briefing on their top races.
“He was a man of the Senate, cared about the Senate, and we said, ‘We really need you to be our point guy,’” Schumer said. “And he has been.”
While most of the public attention has been on the presidential race — and President Barack Obama has so far been holding off on campaigning other than endorsing select candidates with statements and fundraising for party committees — the vice president has quietly embarked on a year-long legacy project for a little political poetic justice.
“The Senate holds a special place in the vice president’s heart and he will be dedicating a significant amount of time this year working to elect a Democratic majority,” said a senior Biden aide. “He views it not just as critical to preserving the progress made by the administration, but also to restoring the effectiveness of a chamber that has become completely mired in dysfunction.”
It’s part frustration with years of the administration’s troubles with Senate Republicans (exacerbated by their refusal to move on Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, and holding up the “Biden rule” as defense), part sales job reinforcing the Obama-Biden record, and part insistence that he can’t leave his party in worse shape than it was when he left the Senate himself.
Biden votes, but keeps mum on his choice By Edward-Isaac Dovere
With Donald Trump making Democrats increasingly confident they’ll keep White House, many see the question shaping up as how many Senate seats Republicans will lose, both because of the top of their ticket and the low poll numbers surrounding their position to deny a confirmation vote on Obama’s Supreme Court nominee.
That’s where Biden comes in.
“The bigger fight is going to be in the Senate,” said Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy, who’s running for an open Florida Senate seat, “and if we can keep the White House and get the Senate, that would be a great way for him to get his legacy.”
Pennsylvania, the state where the vice president helped push the White House to deliver a joint Obama-Biden endorsement for Katie McGinty in the divisive Senate primary, has been a high priority. He’s here Monday in the state’s biggest city the day before the primary for a college affordability event, and is expected to be publicly supportive of McGinty as part of the trip.
He already worked a diner in Pittsburgh with McGinty at the beginning of the month, on top of briefly marching alongside her toward the end of the Pittsburgh parade last Labor Day, an event that was essentially the first and last retail politics event of his presidential flirtation.
Biden has also racked up below-the-national-radar, local press-friendly small events in the Florida, Nevada and Ohio races, weaving in campaign stops as he’s flown around the country promoting his cancer moonshot and anti-campus sexual assault efforts.
“When he started to talk to some women in the diner about the issue of campus rape — that he was also focused on in that trip — it was the furthest thing from talking points. It was real people, real stories,” McGinty said. “They were mesmerized, they were hanging on every word. They were tearing up because what he said was real.”
Biden’s done fundraisers for Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), the most endangered Democratic incumbent, and Catherine Cortez Masto, running to hold Harry Reid’s seat in Nevada, as well as for Washington Sen. Patty Murray, long a Biden favorite.
He’s got two more on the books that he’ll headline in New York City: for New Hampshire hopeful Maggie Hassan on May 9 and Russ Feingold, attempting to win his Wisconsin seat back, on May 26.
Biden&apos;s staff will also be reviving the Twitter and Facebook accounts built up over the 2008 and 2012 elections – they&apos;ve been dormant for the last four years – and turning them over to the Senate effort. They&apos;ll be managed by the Democratic National Committee.
McGinty is not the only endorsement he and Obama have made within a Democratic primary. They’ve also backed Murphy in Florida, former Gov. Ted Strickland in Ohio and Rep. Tammy Duckworth in Illinois.
Strategists planning the races say Biden’s got a practical appeal on top of a political one. Hillary Clinton will have her own race to run, and Bill Clinton will be focused on that. Obama’s schedule is fuller and the security bubble he comes with is harder to wedge into the diner where Biden stumped with McGinty, the walk through the Las Vegas pedestrian mall he did with Cortez Masto, or the soul food restaurant in downtown Miami he worked with Murphy at the end of March.
Pennsylvania is where they’re really leaning into it. In addition to the campaign stops, Biden’s part of a closing-days campaign commercial for McGinty that stars Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, running specifically in the media market in Scranton — the vice president’s hometown.
Biden’s been coming back to Scranton for years, and seeped into the Philadelphia media market for years from neighboring Delaware, and is using that to power events to help Democrats win what was once one of the biggest prize swing states before tilting reliably blue in recent presidential cycles.
“Pretty much everywhere in the state he’s either been to a community several times, and in some communities, hundreds of times,” Casey said.

A Harper poll taken right after Obama and Biden endorsed showed 57 percent of Pennsylvania Democrats saying that the vice president’s support would make them more likely to support a candidate (58 percent said the president’s support would). Other public and private polls haven’t asked the same question, but campaign strategists are confident that the numbers would hold true in nearly every state.
“We know in poll after poll that the vice president is incredibly popular and very trusted,” said DSCC executive director Tom Lopach.
Lopach argued that’s because voters see Biden as closely connected to the Obama administration, which core Democrats are excited about, but just as important for the races they’re running, he is also remembered him as the guy holding hearings and on the Sunday show circuit.
“There’s a whole world of people who do remember him as a senator,” Lopach said. “You cannot have chaired Foreign Relations, Judiciary, served 36 years, been a part of so many major conversations the country has had, without having made a mark on voters.”
Republicans say they’re just as eager to have Biden, with his close association to the administration, on the trail.
“Joe Biden spent a lot of time talking about the Obama-Biden record during the 2014 campaign and that worked out well,” said National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director Andrea Bozek. “His office is free to contact us to help with scheduling.”
Democrats feel like they’ve got a better map and better administration approval ratings to count on this year, and say they’re eager to have Biden leading the charge for them in Senate races through November.
&quot;Ohioans love him,” Strickland said in a statement. “Nobody speaks to the hopes and dreams of working people quite like he does. I’m grateful for the support he’s helped us with, and we’d love to have him here anytime.”
Schumer said Ohio’s a perfect example of the Biden general election appeal, arguing that he’ll be able to help Strickland move both suburban white voters and African-Americans, as he’ll be doing for other candidates around the country.
“He can reach middle class people, average working class people. Those may be a whole lot of the swing voters,” Schumer said.
Murphy said he’s counting not just on more help from Biden, but more receptiveness from voters to the Obama-Biden record as the year goes on, especially with the contrast to the Republican presidential candidates.
“You’ve seen just in the last few months, the approval ratings are coming back. A lot of people looking at their accomplishments are starting to get a slight historical context,” Murphy predicted. “Give it another six, eight months, and people are going to see it even more differently.”

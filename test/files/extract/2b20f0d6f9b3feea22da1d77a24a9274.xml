Perhaps the performance of the day was turned in by Patriot&apos;s Rachel McArthur who won a start-to-finish victory in the 800 meters in meet record time at The Running Store City-County Championship held at Osbourn Park High School on Saturday, April 23, 2016.

The bar is set pretty high and the weight of self-imposed expectations is obviously intense when Patriot junior Rachel McArthur can smash a meet record and beat her nearest competitor by nearly ten seconds, yet McArthur was visibly disappointed after winning the 800-meter race Saturday at the Running Store City/County Track Championships at Osbourn Park High School. For a photo gallery from the meet, click here 
That situation arose, partially because McArthur raced with a sore calf and partly because she felt she had not gone all out in her final tune-up before Thursday’s Penn Relays. 
Alas, that was not the only storyline that emerged Saturday as Osbourn Park’s 4 X 100 relay team of Antoinetta Avant, Ryan Paine, Megan Ogawa, and Gabrielle Hayes also set a new meet record to lead the Yellow Jackets to the girls’ team title by a margin of four points over Patriot. But Patriot’s boys’ team, fueled by Alex Johnson’s win in the 300 hurdles, beat Woodbridge by 21 points. 
It was also a good day for Woodbridge’s Elisha Harrell (who won both the long jump and the triple jump), Freedom’s Igo Grimes (won the 200 and 400 meter dashes), and Forest Park’s Laurence Sneed (part of two winning relay teams for the Bruins). Also, Gar-Field’s Chris Frederick won the 100 meters and was part of a winning relay for the Indians. 
On the girls’ side, Battlefield’s Lauren Hoffman won the 100 hurdles and was part of the Bobcats’ winning 4 X 100 relay team and Osbourn Park’s Gabrielle Hayes (high jump and anchor leg of 4 X 100 relay) and Ryan Paine (part of a winning relay and the 400 meters) also notched wins in multiple events. 
When McArthur won, her face crumpled a bit and she shook her head slightly before having extended conversations with two Patriot coaches, including head coach Adam Daniels. 
But when she talked to a reporter a few moments later, McArthur tried to put a more positive spin on her feelings. 
“I’m fine with the race. It was a solid time,” McArthur said. “I think the natural competitor in me wanted a better time, but I think mentally I just have to step back now and say the [big] race is Thursday. This is just preparing for that. I’m racing against myself and my own time.” 
McArthur admitted that the tremendous success she experienced during her sophomore season put more pressure on her this season. 
“I think what it has taught me is that if you want to be good, you have to work for it,” McArthur said. “Everyone else is getting faster. There’s definitely a lot more pressure, but I like that. I wouldn’t have any motivation if everyone wasn’t there to cheer for me and expect big things from me. I feel like if I am not dead at the finish line—if I don’t give it my all—then I can’t be happy with [my performance].” 
One of the more exciting races happened in the girls’ 400 meters where Paine overtook Patriot’s Erin Andrewlevich, who had the best seed time entering the race, in the final 50 meters. 
“I just focused at the end,” Paine said. “[Andrewlevich] always beats me so I just made it my mission that I was going to beat her today. I knew the track well here and knew how to move well on it, so that was helpful.” 
Osbourn Park’s cause was also aided by several standout performances in the field events. Hayes put on a good show in the high jump where she ignored rain and intermittent heavy gusts of wind to take the title. 
“[The conditions] weren’t looking the best but I just decided I had to go out there and jump and I did,” Hayes said. “High jump is 90 percent mental, so if you think you aren’t going to do good, you aren’t going to do good. I just put that aside and got a good jump.” 
Hayes, whose strong push at the finish during the anchor leg of the 4 X 100 relay proved pivotal, said she was boosted by the friendly environment. 
“Honestly, the crowd was great,” Hayes said. “I heard, ‘They’re [Patriot] coming. They’re coming. And I was just able to outmaneuver her at the end. It was great.” 
Osbourn Park coach Mike Feldman said the team had been building for a performance like this all season. 
“It’s been a long time coming,” Feldman said. “From a team standpoint, for the past couple years, we’ve been behind Patriot and Battlefield, so to finally get in front of them is pretty cool. It was a good matchup for us today. They are both really deep teams. I feel good about our chances going forward, but this is a big win for us, there’s no question about it.” 
Johnson’s victory came in a new event for him. He said he was running the 300 hurdles for the first time against competitors. He ran in the event during a meet on Wednesday but ran by himself, setting a seed time that was higher than all but one other competitor in the race. Johnson’s victory was a bit of an upset as his teammate, Jahvante Marcelle, brought the top seed time into the race. 
“I think the pressure to beat the other runners [helped],” Johnson said. “I looked at the heat sheet before the race and noticed that most of them had lower times than mine, so I knew I had to run hard so I wouldn’t finish in last place.” 
Daniels said Johnson, who has run the hurdles portion of the shuttle relay in indoor track before, is no stranger to the hurdles, though he was essentially competing in the event for the first time Saturday. 
“He did a great job today,” Daniels said of Johnson. “But I was really happy with how they all ran.” 
Grimes said he was proud to win two events, especially because one of his teammates who posted some of the team’s best time, was injured earlier this season, leaving him to carry a bigger portion of the load. 
“We had a great team last year but they all graduated,” Grimes said. “So when one of my main teammates went down, it’s just me. I want to represent well for my team and get the best times I can in every race.” 
One runner who blew away the field, but was not able to post his personal best time or break the meet record he was striving to beat was Forest Park’s Marcelo Febus, who fell short of the record set by his good friend, Joaquin Garcia, who currently runs for George Mason University and who will again be reunited with Febus next fall. 
“When I talk to him later today, I’ll never live it down,” Febus said with a sheepish smile. “I really wanted to get 4:18 [Garcia’s record time], so that’s disappointing, but I had prom the night before, so I was a little tired. It’s not a bad time for these conditions, though.” 
Febus’ time of 4:25.43 was more than nine seconds better than runner-up Osbourn Park’s Alfonso Torres. 
“I was pretty much running by myself, so it was hard [to keep up the intensity],” Febus said.

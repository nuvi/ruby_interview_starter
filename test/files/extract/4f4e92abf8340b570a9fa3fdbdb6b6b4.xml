MADRID -- Extra security measures may be needed to protect athletes staying outside of the Olympic Village during the games in Rio de Janeiro, one of Brazil&apos;s top security officials said Monday. 
Andrei Rodrigues, responsible for overseeing Brazil&apos;s security in special events, said that the need for specific plans was discussed after the local organizing committee said Rafael Nadal was going to stay at a friend&apos;s house instead of the athletes village 
Nadal later denied the information given by Rodrigues, saying that he still intended to stay at the Olympic Village, as he did the other two times he participated in the games. 
Rodrigues said a few golfers are among those who are not staying at the athletes village and who may need special security plans. 
The Brazilian official said that although it would be impossible to provide &quot;personal security&quot; to all athletes in Rio, a few situations could draw special attention from local authorities, who would evaluate those situations on a case-by-case basis. 
&quot;Any action out of the ordinary will obviously prompt greater concern,&quot; Rodrigues told The Associated Press after a media event in Madrid. &quot;We would need to come up with a secondary operation, so that is a concern to us, obviously. It would be more comfortable for us if all athletes stayed in the village and traveled from there to the training venues and to the competition venues.&quot; 
The U.S. men&apos;s and women&apos;s basketball teams will be staying on a cruise ship in Rio&apos;s renovated port area, where increased security is already expected. 
Nadal&apos;s possible presence at a friend&apos;s house prompted special concern because he would not be staying at a hotel, unlike most other athletes skipping the Olympic Village. Most hotels picked by athletes already have their own security measures in place and are well prepared to protect their guests. Authorities in Rio de Janeiro may need to make a plan specifically to protect Rafael Nadal because he will be staying outside the Olympic Village during the Games, one of Brazil&apos;s top security officials said Monday.

Nadal was a star attraction at the Olympic Village in 2008 in Beijing, when he won the gold medal. He was constantly sought out by other athletes for autographs and photos. The Spaniard missed the 2012 London Games because of an injury. 
&quot;The athletes are the VIP clients of the games,&quot; Rodrigues said. &quot;They are the stars and they have to shine, so obviously we need to make sure that they have all the conditions to compete, and for that to happen, we need to keep them safe.&quot; 
Rodrigues did not elaborate on the golfers who are not staying at the Olympic Village. He said members of some equestrian teams also do not plan to use the official Olympic accommodations. 
Rodrigues said organizers do not intend to interfere with the athletes&apos; choices of accommodations, although the local organizing committee can make recommendations based on security concerns. 
The Brazilian official said the most important event in terms of security will be the Games&apos; opening ceremony, when nearly 100 heads of state and about 10,000 athletes will be at the Maracana Stadium. 
He said security in the soccer host cities -- Sao Paulo, Brasilia, Salvador, Manaus and Belo Horizonte -- will follow the same model used during the World Cup two years ago, when no major incidents occurred. comment

  New App May Help End The Shopping Splurge New App May Help End The Shopping Splurge Tweet 
We all know it isn’t easy to save money these days. While a lot of us can blame our small salaries, there’s another major thing holding us back from putting money away... spending. Let’s face it, we all know we probably didn’t need that extra handbag, or pricey bracelet, but who can resist a good splurge? 
A new app is trying to help people do just that. Ally Financial is currently beta testing something they’re calling the “Splurge Alert.” To stop yourself from spending, all you have to do is identify stores or restaurants that are commonly troublesome for you. The app will alert you when you&apos;re near such “splurge zones” via the use of geolocation technology. In addition, folks can identify a “buddy” who’ll get a notification when their friend is close to one of those locations so they can call you and talk them out of spending. 
Ally Financial insists the app isn’t there to harass folks, rather to simply suggest that they should maybe “stop and think” before taking out their plastic. But where&apos;s the fun in that?

WINSFORD’s community champions were crowned at the mayor’s Oscars on Friday. 
The town’s unsung heroes gathered at the Winsford Lifestyle Centre to receive recognition for all their endeavours over the last 12 months. 
Many of the night’s winners have featured in the Guardian over the last year. 
Mark Curzon hit the headlines in February after he transformed his home into a cartoon kingdom following his divorce. 
On Friday the eccentric entertainer picked up the Innovas Performer of the Year. 
Speaking after winning the award, he said: “I&apos;ve been performing five or six nights a week for the last year. 
“It&apos;s a job and I love it. You&apos;re sorted in life in you like what you’re doing.&quot; 
Mark, who also performed on the night, said he was ‘made up’ to win the award, which is his second Oscar in two years. 
“The Winsford community is great. People are getting involved with lots of great things. 
&quot;We&apos;re heading in the right direction.&quot; 
Another winner on the night was Oliver Sherard-Bornshin, who picked up the YMCA Young Person of the Year in recognition for his ‘Be Happy Daddy’ campaign. 
Oliver launched the campaign last November to cheer up his dad after he lost his own father to cancer. The campaign helped raise more than £1000 for St Luke&apos;s Hospice. 
Tony Mitchell, Winsford Over 3 Athletic JFC club secretary, won the Firestone Building Products Europe Volunteer of the Year. 
Tony, who has Parkinson’s disease, has worked with the club for 25 years. 
Readers may recall Tony helping raise more than £7,500 to fund the trip of a lifetime to Barcelona. 
Winsford artists Derek and Anne Johnson – who have featured in the Guardian on a number of occasions over the last 12 months – picked up two awards on the night. 
The husband and wife won the Fords of Winsford Community Initiative of the Year for the Winsford MakerSpace and Rocksalt Art Gallery. 
They also took home the Weaver Vale Housing Trust ‘Walk of Contribution’ award. 
Tributes were also paid on the night to Winsford Town Clerk Alan Warburton, who retires in May. 
A hilarious Mark Curzon-produced tribute video was played for Alan, who has been in the job for nine years. 
“It’s been the best job of my life,” Alan said. “It’s been an absolute pleasure to do my little bit for my home town.” Share:

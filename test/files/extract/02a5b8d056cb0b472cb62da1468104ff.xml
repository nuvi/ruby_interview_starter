2 COMMENTS With a little more than 100 days to go before the start of the Rio Olympics, Comcast Corp. CMCSA -0.48 % ’s NBCUniversal CMCSA -0.48 % is rolling out its largest marketing campaign ever for an event it hopes will set TV viewing records.
The marketing push, which NBCUniversal executives value at $100 million, 33% more than four years ago, will span TV ads, social media and online video.
The messaging blitz illustrates just how much is riding on the success of the company’s signature sports property at a time when Brazil’s economic problems, political turmoil and health concerns sparked by the Zika virus, are dominating headlines in the run-up to the event, which takes place Aug. 5 through Aug. 21, though the Olympic soccer tournament​ begins on August 3rd.
Since 2011, NBCU has invested some $12 billion to secure all U.S. media rights for the Olympics through 2032, including $1.2 billion for the Rio Games. Moreover, production costs are likely to reach about $200 million.
The Olympics have often been a loss-leader for NBC, which has televised every Summer Games since 1988, but as these costs grow, the stakes rise for the company to get a return. There is growing pressure to make the Games profitable.
The risk is that all the negative news out of Brazil could deflect attention from the Games or, worse, discourage athletes from participating and hurt TV or digital viewing. NBC executives, however, are confident that won’t happen. They note that there have been controversies at many past Olympics, from Athens to Beijing, that ultimately didn’t have a big negative impact. The idea is to turn the Games into “an oasis in a sea of bad news,” said John Miller, NBC’s chief marketing officer for the event.
NBCU-owned channels from broadcast network NBC to cable networks such as Bravo, USA and NBCU’s Spanish-language networks will be blanketing their shows with 7,500 national Olympic promotional spots that will become especially prevalent in June and July.
The company also will enlist local TV stations nationwide to air videos highlighting area athletes and will show Olympic-themed videos to tourists at its Universal Studios theme park in Orlando. The goal is to make an impression on every U.S. resident 65 times and to try to surpass the London records of 217 million U.S. viewers and $1.2 billion in revenues.
The media company plans to spend about $15 million on ad time on non-Comcast/NBCU owned properties, with a significant portion to be dedicated to social media and digital-video advertising. The hope is the social-media buzz will help NBCU get younger people more interested in the games. The median age of Summer Olympics viewers increased from 46.9 in 2008 to 48.2 in 2012, according to Billie Gold, director of programming at Dentsu Inc., 4324 -1.81 % one of the world’s largest ad companies.
For youth-obsessed advertisers that trend is worrisome. “Advertisers want to see the numbers [ratings] go up on the younger demos, unless it’s a pharmaceutical company,” said Jason Kanefsky, executive vice president of strategic investments at Havas Media, an ad buying unit of ad conglomerate Havas SA HAV 0.26 % .
To reach the millennial crowd, NBCU is using BuzzFeed—it invested $200 million in the digital-media company last year—to create some Olympic-themed content, and it has relinquished editorial control. Mr. Miller of NBC acknowledged there was a risk in that but added that in today’s world “when the message comes from the man, people don’t trust it.”
The Olympics carry some of the most expensive advertising on television. NBC announced this month it had exceeded $1 billion in sales for Rio, a plateau it didn’t reach until just days before the 2012 London Games.
The company is selling prime-time 30-second spots for up to $1 million, ad buyers said. To be sure, less desirable Olympic-ad inventory running on cable networks during non-prime-time hours can cost advertisers about $15,000 for a 30-second spot, said one buyer. Highly desirable ad inventory, such as the opening ceremony, largely has been reserved for marketers that were willing to buy ad packages exceeding $10 million, some of the buyers said.
NBC has guaranteed some advertisers an audience at least as big as those that tune in for NFL Sunday Football, which averaged more than 20 million viewers last season. If ratings fail to meet that guarantee, NBCU would have to give marketers additional ad time to make up for the shortfall.
NBCUniversal will produce more than 6,000 hours of Olympic programming this year, compared with just more than 5,500 from London, and much of it will be televised or streamed live.
Given the increase in the number of hours, and the fact that the time difference in Rio is just one hour later than the eastern U.S., executives are hopeful that surpassing London’s viewership and revenue is within reach, despite the problems in Brazil.
Breaking the records will depend, in part, on the performance of Team USA, which struggled at the 2015 World Championships in its top two sports, swimming and track and field.
NBC executives are hoping for a robust first few days, especially in the pool where Michael Phelps, who is attempting to make his fifth Olympic team, and the U.S. swimmers have been dominant for more than a decade.
“I think we will do better than London,” said Seth Winter, executive vice president for sales at NBC Sports, referring to the revenue goals.

Such irony - the big talk in this country of income inequality (which is real) and the money spent on the world&apos;s three biggest marketing events - Olympics, Super Bowl and World Cup.
The have-nots join the throngs of haves and nearly haves in supporting these money-gulping events.
Of course, they entertain many, but it speaks to the power of marketing - that humans will sit during a Super Bowl and watch sponsors&apos; commercials as if they are art, and gawk at halftime shows presented by the one percent of one percenters. And that&apos;s all way cool.
Go figure.

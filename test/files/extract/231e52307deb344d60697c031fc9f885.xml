Jodie Marsh | © jodiemarsh Instagram Posted on Monday 25 April 2016 
Jodie Marsh has revealed plans she is going to have a baby using a sperm donor following her recent split from her husband James Placido. 
The pair announced their break up last week after just eight months of marriage and now it has emerged the reality star would still like to have her own family despite the break-up. 
Speaking about her split, the 37-year-old told her Twitter followers ‘I have to carry on as normal’ before going on to announce her plans for a family. I have to carry on as normal because I refuse to fall apart.... — Jodie Marsh (@JodieMarsh) 21 April 2016 The future is this: I&apos;m making 2 more shows for @tlc_uk then I&apos;m going to revisit having a baby via sperm donation #itsallaboutME — Jodie Marsh (@JodieMarsh) 21 April 2016 
The star, who recently became a bodybuilder, told one fan she had already been looking into sperm donation to have a child before she began her whirlwind romance with James. 
Jodie’s fans were very supportive of her decision, messaging her with well wishes after the announcement. One fan told her she is ‘Truly inspirational’ whilst another said ‘You are born to be a mum’. @JodieMarsh @tlc_uk love the shows! Seen how much you want to be a mother..

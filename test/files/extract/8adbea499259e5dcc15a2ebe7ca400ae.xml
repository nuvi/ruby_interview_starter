Dutch theatre-maker stages Alzheimer’s play There is one performance only of this play 9 hours ago 
TWIST Theatre Development Projects hosts the visiting Dutch theatre-maker, Kees van Loenen’s moving one-man play ‘The Cloak of Charity’, which is a tribute to the caregiver of an Alzheimer’s patient, to be staged at Musgrave Methodist Church hall for one performance only on Thursday, 12 May at 10am. 
Detailing the first few moments of forgetfulness, and then not-so-subtle descent of his mother into Alzheimer’s, the play details a son’s struggle with coping with his mother’s loss of memory and then his own loss of her. It is a funny, touching, and beautiful tribute both to the patient and the care-giver. 
There is one performance only of this play. The performance lasts 45 minutes, and is followed by a discussion with the performer, care-givers of patients with Alzheimer’s and audience members. 
Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia, a general term for memory loss and other intellectual abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. It is a progressive mental deterioration that can occur in middle or old age, due to generalised degeneration of the brain. It is the commonest cause of premature senility. 
There will be plenty of on-street parking outside the Musgrave Methodist Church hall at 237 Musgrave Road. Admission is free, and all are welcome but attendance must be confirmed. For more details and to RSVP, call Alan or Illa at Publicity Matters on 031-2011638 or info@pubmat.co.za SHARE

  11:10 Nick Kroll, John Mulaney add another date for sold-out &apos;Oh, Hello&apos; In &quot;Oh, Hello,&quot; Kroll and Mulaney play two comedically crotchety old men named Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland who love wearing turtlenecks and blazers almost as much as they love Alan Alda. The personas grew out of a skit called &quot;Too Much... Share on Facebook Tweet 
Comedians Nick Kroll and John Mulaney will perform one more night in L.A. of their sold-out show, &quot;Oh, Hello,&quot; representatives said Monday. 
The show had a five-night run at Hollywood&apos;s Montalban theater in early April. The added performance will be June 18 at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre, and tickets went on sale Monday. 
In &quot;Oh, Hello,&quot; Kroll and Mulaney play two comedically crotchety old men named Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland who love wearing turtlenecks and blazers almost as much as they love Alan Alda. The personas grew out of a skit called &quot;Too Much Tuna,&quot; which became popular on Kroll&apos;s eponymous Comedy Central show and featured the men presenting obscenely stuffed tuna sandwiches to celebrity guests. Nick Kroll, John Mulaney and their geezer alter egos take on L.A. Jessica Gelt 
Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland think they&apos;re the funniest people in the room. Their creators, however, comedians Nick Kroll and John Mulaney, know that most of the time Faizon and St. Geegland are incredibly tedious, which, conversely, is what makes them so funny to watch. 
So goes the premise...

The &quot;Too Much Tuna&quot; gag is not one to die easily, and it made for laughs during the Los Angeles run of &quot;Oh, Hello,&quot; which featured celebrity guests including Lena Dunham, Marcia Clark, Bill Hader, Andy Samberg and Meghan Trainor. 
If you&apos;re wondering what you missed in April and what you might see during the June show of &quot;Oh, Hello,&quot; here&apos;s an exclusive video of Faizon and St. Geegland serving far too much tuna to Clark and Hader at the Montalban.

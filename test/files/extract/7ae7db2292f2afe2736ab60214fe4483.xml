NEW YORK (CNNMoney) 
Remember Hi-C Ecto Cooler? It&apos;s coming back! 
Coca-Cola is bringing back its 80s and 90s nostalgia brand Hi-C Ecto Cooler, timing the launch with the new &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; movie. 
&quot;Fans of the ghoulish green goodness of Hi-C Ecto Cooler have one more reason to celebrate the return of the &apos;Ghostbusters&apos; franchise to the silver screen,&quot; said Coca-Cola in a press release. 
The drink, which was on the market from 1987 to 2001, looks a lot like the ectoplasm produced by ghosts such as Slimer, the famous floating glutton from the first &quot;Ghostbuster&quot; movie. 
Coca-Cola said Ecto Cooler will be available in stores May 30, ahead of the July 15 release date for the next &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; movie starring Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Chris Hemsworth. 
Stars from the original movie, including Bill Murray, Sigourney Weaver and, of course, Slimer, will also appear in the new movie. 
Ecto-Cooler will be sold in 10-packs of 6-ounce juice boxes, and also 6-packs and 12-packs of 11.5-ounce cans. 
&quot;The cans are specially printed using thermal ink that turns an eerie shade of slime green when the product inside is cold,&quot; the company said. 
Fans can enter a contest to try and win the drink ahead of the release date.

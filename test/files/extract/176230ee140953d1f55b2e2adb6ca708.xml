Description 1. No Politics Political videos—including content relating to social issues which have a clear political element —should be submitted to /r/PoliticalVideo . This includes submissions of current or recent political figures in any context, satire/political-comedy, and posts on political topics from within the last 10 years. 2. No Personal Information Such as names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. This can also include contact information of public officials or groups (see rule 3). This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this a warning. 3. No Witch-Hunting Or incitement to witch-hunt. This means no demanding &quot;Reddit Justice&quot; in any way in post titles or comments. This also includes posting contact information of public officials or groups in an any manner that could be seen as an attempt to get users to contact them. 4. No Videos of Police Brutality or Police Harassment Consider submitting those to a different subreddit, like /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut or elsewhere. 5. Submit Direct Link to Video No web pages that only embed Youtube or Vimeo videos. No URL shorteners. No links to playlists or to channel pages. 6. No Porn or Gore There are many other subreddits for such content. 7. No Solicitation of Votes or Views. No Asking for Votes or Sharing Submission Links On or Off-Site (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) Violations can lead to a permanent ban of accounts and video channels. 8. No Hate Speech You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group, acontextual expressions of bigotry, and the pejorative use of slurs is disallowed. 9. No Videos of Real-Life, Malicious Person-On-Person Assault/Battery or Physical Abuse of Animals This includes raw videos of fights. 10. No Third Party Licensing No videos that are licensed by a third party. Videos that become licensed after they are posted will be removed. Please see this thread for a more detailed explanation.

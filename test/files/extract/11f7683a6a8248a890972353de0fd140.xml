[caption id=&quot;attachment_30120&quot; align=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot;] &apos;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&apos; image courtesy of Paramount[/caption]Here is the third portion of my ongoing summer movie preview. Today we will look at the would-be &quot;underdogs&quot; or &quot;runners-up.&quot; These are films that will probably be big, possibly be huge, and would arguably be considered top-tier A-level summer tentpoles in a prior era. And yes, I sometimes refer to these as the new B-movies, in that we are at a point where a Dwayne Johnson/Kevin Hart action comedy or a Steven Spielberg fantasy is basically on a slightly lower rung of blockbuster-dom as opposed to the likes of Captain America: Civil War or Finding Dory . And if there is going to be a &quot;surprise&quot; breakout smash this summer, it&apos;s probably going to come from this batch of six movies. As always, these will be in the order of release date. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (June 3rd)The last TMNT film was an unqualified smash, earning $191 million U.S. and $493m worldwide on a $125m budget. But it wasn&apos;t terribly good. Paramount/Viacom Inc. has a tough job of convincing you that Out of the Shadows is a better and poppier entertainment. So far the trailers have been outright superb, promising a more colorful and fantastical adventure along with fan-friendly added value elements like Krang, Baxter Stockman, and Casey Jones. This one could fall victim to the Tomb Raider Trap, but since it still cost around the same $125m that the first film did, it can take a hit and still be a hit. My son is beyond psyched for this. The Conjuring 2 (June 10th) The Conjuring was a horror movie that played like a tentpole. It earned strong reviews. It opened with $41 million (still a record for an original R-rated horror film). Then the film legged it like a champ to a $137m domestic/$318m worldwide on a $20m budget for Warner Bros./Time Warner Inc. Maybe lightning can&apos;t strike twice. But the (not very good) Annabelle earned $256m worldwide in late 2014 with only a tenuous connection to the original, so there is clearly a demand for films set in this particular world. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are back, as is director James Wan (coming off of Furious 7 and with Aquaman on tap). Conventional wisdom says this sequel will make less because it&apos;s a sequel. But The Conjuring performed like no horror movie I had seen since The Ring if not Silence of the Lambs . Central Intelligence (June 17th)There aren&apos;t very many outright original live-action features above a certain budgetary level coming to a theater near you this year. So it is entirely possible that this over/under $60 million action comedy will be the year&apos;s biggest grossing live-action original. Dwayne Johnson is a &quot;face in the trailer/puts butts in the seats&quot; action star. Kevin Hart is a &quot;face in the trailer/puts butts in the seats&quot; comic star. Putting them together for an action comedy that allows them to bounce off of each other in their somewhat standard characters is a no-brainer. If it can play like Ride Along in America and Hercules overseas, that&apos;s $310m worldwide right there. And that&apos;s a low-ball figure. Expect Central Intelligence 2 , hopefully with Melissa McCarthy as the villain, in summer 2018 or 2019. The BFG. (July 1st)It is a little bizarre that we&apos;ve reached a point where a Steven Spielberg-directed, Melissa Mathison-penned adaptation of a famous Roald Dahl novel is considered one of Walt Disney&apos;s smaller-scale releases this summer. But that&apos;s the situation. Even though July 4th weekend isn&apos;t entirely good for legs, I assume Disney expects a leggy run for this (surely terrific?) kid-friendly fantasy film. There are no real &quot;stars&quot; (sorry Mark Rylance and Rebecca Hall), but it&apos;s the fifth of five Disney biggies dropping between April 15th and July 1st. Afterward, it&apos;s six weeks until Pete&apos;s Dragon closes out the summer on August 12th. So, come what may, Disney will have time to devote to this one. And c&apos;mon, it&apos;s a Steven Spielberg adaptation of a (pretty creepy and disconcerting) Roald Dahl book. Is there any chance this isn&apos;t terrific? The Secret Lives of Pets (July 10th)It&apos;s possible this Illumination animated feature will vastly overperform this year. Two-thirds of America has at least one pet in their home, and the other one-third has presumably interacted with said pets on a somewhat regular interval. So a kid-friendly comedy, about housebound animals getting into mischief while their owners are away, appeals to every single moviegoer in the country, if not the world. So why was it not in the &quot;sure bets&quot; list? Maybe I screwed up and oversold Star Trek Beyond , perhaps I wanted to spread the wealth among the studios, or maybe I thought it might be another Hop . It still could be, or it could be another Despicable Me -style breakout that gives Universal/Comcast Corp. another homegrown franchise. But it better be filled with cat jokes! Pete&apos;s Dragon (August 12th)This David Lowery &quot;live-action adaptation of an animated classic&quot; looks to be a smaller-scale, more grounded and low-key affair. Refashioning the story as something approaching (simplification alert) &quot; Mama , but for kids,&quot; the relative success of this Bryce Dallas Howard/Robert Redford drama mean more smaller-scale/less grandiose Disney adaptations should the source material demand it. It&apos;s the last big (arguably) guaranteed hit movie of the summer, opening a week before Paramount&apos;s Ben-Hur remake. And it has the key advantage of having its terrific teaser playing in front of four months-worth of Walt Disney blockbusters from The Jungle Book to The BFG . Oh, and Disney is so happy with the film that they&apos;ve hired Lowery for their just-announced Peter Pan revamp.Okay, that&apos;s a wrap for this installment. Next up is next week&apos;s look at old-school and/or adult-skewing &quot;movies&quot; playing at a theater near you in the heart of the summer season. And for those asking, there will be no female-centric post this year because there are so few female-led multiplex offerings this summer.

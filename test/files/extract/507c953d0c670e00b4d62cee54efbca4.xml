Bale &apos;surprised&apos; at Man City&apos;s slow Champions League progress Getty Images 0 26-Apr-2016 00:10:00 The Madrid winger has seen the Premier League club progress under Manuel Pellegrini during his time in Spain, but suggested he had expected them to have reached the semis sooner Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale says he is surprised Manchester City have not reached the Champions League semi-finals sooner.Bale will play his first game in England since his 2013 switch to the Santiago Bernabeu when Madrid take on City on Tuesday evening, the first time the Premier League club have advanced this far in the competition.City have won their second league title and the League Cup since Bale moved to Spain, and are now making waves in the Champions League.The Welshman has noted the Blues&apos; progress from afar, but says he would have expected them to have made a bigger impression on the biggest stage.&quot;If anything I’m surprised they haven’t got here earlier,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;They’ve progressed over the years. They’ve been a force in the Premier League and starting to be in Europe. Hopefully now we can stop them.&quot;With Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid contesting the other semi, City are the bookmakers&apos; outsiders to lift the trophy this season.Bayern are on course to win the Bundesliga title once more and Atletico are locked in a three-way battle for La Liga, while City had crashed out of the Premier League race by mid March and have endured a patchy campaign.But Bale does not believe facing Manuel Pellegrini&apos;s men will be any easier than if Madrid have been handed another tie, especially now he feels they have corrected the issues that saw them dice with quarter-final elimination at the hands of Wolfsburg. | Zidane confirms Ronaldo will travel to face Man City &quot;No matter who you face in the semi-final they’re a great team,&quot; he added. &quot;They’re here on merit. No matter who we faced it was a difficult game.&quot;&quot;We’re feeling confident at the moment. We’ve not had great performance away at Wolfsburg but we’ve learned from it and corrected it. We need to impose ourselves.&quot;The Welshman also refuted the suggestion he has anything to prove on his return to the British Isles, instead focusing on trying to secure Madrid&apos;s passage to the final as early as possible: &quot;I don’t feel I have a point to prove. &quot;I’ve played long enough to be OK about that. We want to stamp our authority and win by as many goals as we can. It&apos;s going to be difficult. The first legs are always a bit tense, a bit cagey. It’ll be great to score goals, but all we’re going to do is give our best. Hopefully that’ll be enough.&quot; Related

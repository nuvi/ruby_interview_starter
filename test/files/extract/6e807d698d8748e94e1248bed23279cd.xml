Mock Draft Monday: Steelers select a CB in Round 1, but did they make the right choice? By Jeff.Hartman  @BnGBlitz on Apr 25, 2016, 11:12a + Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports In the FINAL Mock Draft Monday, the Steelers take a CB in the first round, but the question on whether it is the right choice still remains.  Share Share on Facebook + Comments 
In the final Mock Draft Monday of the 2016 calendar year (Hooray!), the same song and dance continues with people projecting the Pittsburgh Steelers taking a cornerback in the first round of the NFL Draft . There are a number of players who have caught the team&apos;s attention throughout this process, and defensive backs ruled when it came to the team&apos;s official pre-draft visits. 
Therefore, the position which was selected in the latest, and final, SB Nation Mock Draft shouldn&apos;t shock anyone. They have the Steelers projected to take a cornerback, but who they selected could be a hot-button topic of debate until the first round of the draft officially starts Thursday at 8:00 p.m. EDT. 
Take a look at who they have the Steelers picking, and their reasoning: 
25. Pittsburgh Steelers: Mackensie Alexander, CB, Clemson 
The Steelers need cornerback help badly, and Alexander is capable of playing a variety of styles against different types of receivers. There have been reports that he might rub people the wrong way, but he&apos;s an incredible talent. 
There is no doubt Alexander has talent, and a pedigree coming from Clemson to back up the thought of him being a top tier defensive back in the NFL. However, looking at who else was available when the team selected at No. 25 certainly will be worth discussing. 
This mock draft has the Steelers choosing Alexander over Eli Apple, Kendall Fuller, Artie Burns and even William Jackson III. 
So, the team takes a cornerback, but did they take the right one? 
All defensive back prospects have their weaknesses. They are rookies, and will make mistakes, but the Steelers need to try and find the most NFL-ready player to help pick up a depleted and sagging secondary heading into the 2016 NFL season. Is that player Alexander? It could be, but there are aspects of all available players which scream of a player who will take time to develop. 
Therefore, with mock drafts starting to die down, the days of projections and estimations are coming to an end, but if the Steelers do choose to take a CB in the first round, and they have their choice of the above prospects, which would be the most NFL-ready player, in your opinion. Go ahead and vote in the poll below, and feel free to explain your choice in the comment section below. Poll Which of the following CBs is the most &quot;NFL-Ready&quot;? Mackensie Alexander

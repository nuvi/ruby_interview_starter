Theater Killer Instinct: Playwright Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa Brings “American Psycho” To Broadway &quot;We have to see [Patrick] struggle and change the world around him in order to be invested in his story.&quot; by Dan Avery 46m ago 
I first met Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa when we were both at the start of our careers: I was a young arts writer in D.C., where he was staging Archie Loves Nathan , about thecomic-book redhead’s illicit gay affair with real-life sociopath Nathan Leopold. Facebook 
Roberto’s gone on to bigger things since then—writing for Glee and Looking , getting named Chief Creative Officer of Archie Comics, and bringing Riverdale to the CW , among them. 
But he still has a thing for charismatic serial killers, as evidenced by his latest project: Writing the book for the new musical adaptation of American Psycho , now on Broadway. The musical already had a successful run on London’s West End, with Doctor Who ’s Matt Smith as yuppy killer Patrick Bateman. 
But it’s undergone a significant evolution since then—and not just with the addition of Benjamin Walker as the show’s new leading man. 
“There have been substantial changes since London,” says Aguirre-Sacasa. “Especially in Act One. There are three or four new numbers—we dig into Patrick’s character a bit more. There’s a little more Nine in there.” 
As for Walker, the playwright praises his cool sexual magnetism. “He just exists and sex happens around him.” 
Other characters have been added and fleshed out from the original book, including a closeted coworker Patrick has a “faltering romance” with, and Bateman’s mother, played by Tony winner Alice Ripley ( Next to Normal ). 
“Patrick’s mom has a small part int he book, and wasn’t in the movie at all,” he recalls. “But when we wanted to look at Patrick through the lens of the women in his life, I was intrigued by the mom in the book. So we wrote her in one scene—but as we rehearsed in London we got more intrigued and wrote her in more.” 
Getting Ripley for the role on Broadway was, he says, “luxury casting.” 
Aguirre-Sacasa says he realized early on that Patrick would have to have more depth and a more defined arc in the musical than in previous incarnations. “We’re dramatizing his struggle, even if we don’t put a name to it—like ’he’s like this because of his father.’ We have to see him struggle and change the world around him in order to be invested in his story.” 
That doesn’t mean audiences will be cheering Patrick on as he eviscerates his victims, though. 
“He will always be an anti-hero,” insists Aguirre-Sacasa. While he praises Walker’s ability to show different facets of the character “I don’t know that we’ll ever empathize with Patrick.” Walter McBride/Getty Images 
Aguirre-Sacasa is also in awe of Duncan Sheik (above, second from right), who wrote the show’s music. 
“He is an artist with a capital A,” he says of the Spring Awakening mastermind. “He really cannot help but write good songs—they’re all winners.” 
Initially, he reveals, Sheik’s involvement was going to be less prominent: “It went from, we’ll do four songs from Duncan and we’ll do the rest jukebox songs. And even then, Sheik re-orchestrated the hits to give them a fresh feel. 
But while Spring Awakening has a rebellious rock vibe, Psycho is infused with the New Wave sound of the 1980s. “You Are What You Wear” has notes of the Pet Shop Boys, while “Killing Spree” is Sheik’s homage to “Hungry Like the Wolf.” But does a 25-year-old critique of 1980s excess still have resonance in 2016? 
“There’s an apocalyptic feeling to this story that is still definitely around. The theme of money and greed is still obviously an issue,” he says, pointing to Wolf of Wall Street and the Big Short. If anything, American Psycho predicted a lot of what we’ve seen in the last few years.” 
Time hasn’t mellowed the story or re-contextualized it, he says. 
“I mean, what else is Patrick Bateman if not the ultimate One Percenter?” 
American Psycho is currently playing at the Schoenfeld Theatre.

Bluff MMA warrior to fight for SA I am excited to go and happy I was invited. 6 hours ago Keagan Wroots trains in the Team Undisputed gym with Sheldon Hughes. 
FIGHTING his way to the world stage, Bluff MMA warrior, Keagan Wroots has been selected as part of the South African squad for the 2016 world championships. 
The 25-year-old who trains at the Bluff’s Team Undisputed gym will head to Las Vegas in June as part of the 30-strong MMA national squad. 
“I am excited to go and happy I was invited. I am looking forward to going, even though the extra training will mean less sleep,” said Keagan. 
Described as a crowd pleaser, role model and pleasant person to be around, the ex-Fairvale Secondary School pupil started fighting seven years ago. He dabbled in boxing and kickboxing before stepping into the MMA ring. 
His family, who at first didn’t approve of him fighting, are now his biggest supporters. 
“In the beginning, I started fighting because I wanted to learn to defend myself, then I fell in love with it.” 
Keagan will join the rest of his squad for training in Johannesburg in May ahead of the championships from 4 to 10 July. All costs are at his own expense and he needs to raise R30,000 to get there. 
Fight manager and club liaison Lizette Du Plessis said Keagan is a motivated, optimistic and inspirational young man who deserves the opportunity. She calls on anyone willing to sponsor Keagan or wanting to make a donation to contact her. 
After the world championships, Keagan, who works in radiographic testing, hopes to take his fighting career further and become an internationally-renowned professional fighter. 
Anyone interested in supporting Keagan can contact Lizette on 079-128-8506 or duplessis.lizette@yahoo.com. Keagan Wroots.

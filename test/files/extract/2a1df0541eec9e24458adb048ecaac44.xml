Jodie Sweetin almost broke her nose during ‘DWTS’ rehearsals   
LOS ANGELES, Apr 25: “Fuller House” star Jodie Sweetin nearly broke her nose as she attempted a difficult dance move with her partner Keo Motsepe while rehearsing for “Dancing with the Stars”. The actress also suffered an ankle injury earlier, reported Entertainment Weekly. Sweetin seemed to hit her nose on Motsepe’s wrist as he spun her in the air. She immediately ran out of the room in pain while holding her nose.“Sorry,” Motsepe said as she put an ice pack on her nose. She was in a white tank top and grey sweatpants while he was shirtless. Sweetin was hospitalised a few days ago after twisting her ankle in a rehearsal. (PTI) Share this:

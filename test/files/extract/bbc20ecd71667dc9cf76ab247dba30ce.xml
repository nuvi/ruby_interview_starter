So much of the conversation about this year&apos;s presidential race has centered around the way we choose delegates. Ahead of primary day Tuesday, here&apos;s a breakdown of how the process will work for both parties and a list of the delegates already committed to a candidate. 
Republicans 
John Micek, Editorial and Opinions Editor for PennLive and The Patriot-News, provided a clip-and-save user&apos;s guide to everything you need to know about delegates back in early March. 
According to Ballotpedia , Republicans, with a total of just 71 delegates, have three kinds of delegates too. 
They are: district delegates, at-large delegates and RNC delegates. 
District delegates: There are 54 district delegates, who are &quot;&quot;elected on the primary ballot as officially unbound.&quot; In other words, they&apos;re not required to pledge their support to whoever wins Pennsylvania&apos;s Republican primary. 
At-Large delegates: These 14 delegates, according to Ballotpedia, are awarded on a winner-take-all basis. So if you&apos;re the plurality winner of the primary, they&apos;re yours. 
RNC delegates: The biggest of the big shots. These three, national party leaders are required to pledge their support to whomever wins the GOP primary. 
Here&apos;s how PennLive Capitol Bureau reporter Charlie Thompson broke down the individual commitments and the process for the Republican candidates in this Saturday post: 
When Pennsylvania Republicans cast a ballot for a presidential nominee Tuesday, they really want to vote as many as four times. 
Here&apos;s why. 
You vote once for the actual candidate you like: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich or business mogul Donald Trump. 
And then, you vote up to three more times in a down-ballot race for the directly-elected delegates who will actually cast the ballots at the Republican National Covention. 
Each of the state&apos;s 18 congressional districts sends three directly-elected delegates to the convention, where they are joined by another 17 party-selected, at-large delegates who are committed to support the top vote-getter on the first ballot. 
The problem is, unique-in-the-nation state party rules provide for the district delegate candidates to be listed on the ballot with no presidential preference designated. 
So voters need to be pro-active in trying to make sure they&apos;re picking delegates who want the same candidate. Or, just as likely in this race, delegates who at least aren&apos;t committed to support the candidates they don&apos;t want. 
What&apos;s a Pennsylvania delegate and how do I become one? 
Two of the three still-standing GOP campaigns – Cruz&apos;s and Trump&apos;s, after weeks of Keystone State recruiting - have released partial slates of endorsed candidates, which PennLive shares here in the name of voter education. Ohio Gov. John Kasich&apos;s campaign - which lagged badly in early Pennsylvania organizing and is really based now on a coalition of supporters of other candidates who have left the race - has not developed a public slate.
We&apos;ll get back to that in a moment. 
But first, here&apos;s a rundown of those candidates that ardent Cruz and Trump supporters should feel good about sending to the convention floor, listed by campaign district (CD). 
Please note, the candidates here are solely those listed on the slates put together by the campaigns. 
In some districts, there are more than three endorsed candidates for a single candidate. In others, there are additional, self-declared supporters that have not received the campaign&apos;s support. 
And in a handful, the national campaigns aren&apos;t backing anyone.

Donald Trump

John Kasich 
11th, central / NE PA: Bill Urbanski 
Committed to support top district vote-getter 
4th, Harrisburg / York: Greg Rothman, Charlie Gerow, Betsy Hower**, Stan Saylor, Alexander Shorb, Scott Burford**, Andrew Ritter. 
** Burford (leaning Kasich) and Hower said they would pledge their first-ballot vote to the top statewide vote-getter. 
6th, Philly suburbs: Larry Stohler*, Doug Hager, Ryan Costello, Michelle Kichline, Vicki Lightcap** 
* Stohler says his first ballot vote would go to the top statewide vote-getter. 
** Lightcap is endorsed as a delegate candidate by the Trump campaign, but she has stated that she will support the top vote-getter in the 6th District on a first ballot. 
9th, central PA: Judy Ward 
11th, central / NE PA: Sue Helm, Rebecca Warren 
15th, Lehigh Valley: Scott Uehlinger*, William Heydt

9th central PA: Bill Shuster, Bob Thomas 
11th, central / NE PA: Richard Adams, Don Sherwood 
15th, Lehigh Valley: Ryan Mackenzie 
16th, Lancaster County: Gordon Denlinger 
Did not respond / could not be reached 
11th, central / NE PA: Jeff Haste** 
** Haste was listed last week as one of five Cruz selections in the 11th District. 
15th, Lehigh Valley: Robert E. Smith Jr. 
Senior adviser and former Pennsylvania Congressman Robert Walker said Friday that the lack of a slate should not be construed as a sign Kasich lacks support. 
&quot;We&apos;ve talked extensively to the delegates ... and he is getting a very favorable response,&quot; Walker said. 
But the Ohio governor has chosen to play more of an establishment game, Walker said, letting regional party organizations try to elect their own favorites as delegates who are ultimately interested in nominating the most electable candidate. 
That&apos;s where Kasich – who has polled better than Trump or Cruz in some hypothetical match-ups against Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton - thinks his case is strongest. 
Republican Primary: How the Pennsylvania election system works 
Walker said he believes these party regulars will fare well Tuesday because existing county committees will be able to do precinct-by-precinct voter education across sprawling Congressional districts, something he doubts either the Cruz or Trump camps are prepared for. 
Most of these unattached delegate candidates have said they will either vote for the popular vote winner in their district on the convention&apos;s first nomination ballot – in a nod to the voters – or are remaining fully uncommitted. 
On second or subsequent ballots, then, Walker says, the Kasich plan is to press his case that he&apos;s the best general election candidate for the Republican Party, and grow support as a consensus first- or second-choice. 
The calculated risk, of course, is that frontrunner Trump locks down the 1,237 delegates he needs for a convention majority in the remaining Republican primaries, in which case there won&apos;t be a second- or third-ballot. 
Democrats 
From Micek, here&apos;s what he wrote about their less-confusing delegate process: 
Remember what Will Rogers said about not belonging to an organized political party because he was a Democrat? Yeah, like that. Only moreso. 
As our friends at PoliticsPA note, Democrats have three kind of delegates: Pledged, un-pledged and bonus. There are 234 in total. 
Pledged delegates: These folks are determined based on the votes that John Kerry and Barack Obama received in the state in 2004, 2008 and 2012. As PoliticsPa notes, the more than 9.2 million aggregate votes from those three contests are plugged into a mathematical formula, resulting in 189 pledged delegates. 
Un-pledged delegates: These would be the so-called &quot;Super-Delegates&quot; that you&apos;ve been hearing so much about lately. As PoliticsPA notes, they include the 13 state members of the Democratic National Committee; Gov. Tom Wolf; U.S Sen. Bob Casey, and the state&apos;s five Democratic members of the U.S. House. There&apos;s also one set aside for &quot;distinguished party leaders.&quot; All told, there are 21 Super-Delegates. 
Bonus delegates: There are 34 bonus delegates, who are awarded based on individual states&apos; efforts to prolong the drama by holding primaries later in the cycle, or by holding their primaries on the same day as other states, PolitcsPA notes. Thus, Pennsylvania gets a 15 percent delegate bonus for holding its primary on the same day as Maryland and Delaware. 
If you&apos;re really a glutton for punishment, or it&apos;s been a while since your last psychotic episode, you can read a more complete ( and brain-bogglingly complex ) explanation of the Democratic delegate rules here. PENNLIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA

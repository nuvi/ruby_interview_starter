What Will the CFO Role Look Like in 2020? 
About 60% of employers offer such a program, according to Jamie Merisotis, CEO of Lumina, an independent nonprofit organization that works to increase the proportion of Americans with high-quality degrees, certificates, and other credentials. But Lumina estimates that only about 2% to 5% of such employers evaluate the programs’ economic ROI. “Very few of those share their results publicly,” Merisotis says, in what may be an understatement. 
Lumina engaged Accenture Consulting to conduct a series of studies aimed at quantifying the ROI of major employers’ tuition assistance programs. Cigna volunteered its Education Reimbursement Program (ERP) to be one of the first ones evaluated, and results of the study are the first to be made public. 
“If many companies have results like Cigna has achieved, and we think they do, that means tuition assistance, which has traditionally been treated as a benefit, is actually going to look much more like an investment than a cost center for these companies,” says Merisotis. 
Cigna wanted to assess the impact of tuition assistance investment on both revenue generation and talent management costs. But because of the diversity of the company’s performance metrics across its workforce, it was unable to identify any revenue factors for which data was accessible for the entire population of program participants. 
Therefore, the analysis focused just on the impact on talent management costs. The 129% figure includes savings related to employee promotions, retentions, and transfers. 
Specifically, the research found that ERP participants were 10% more likely than other employees to be promoted. That saves money because the more senior the position, the more difficult it is to fill through recruitment. 
Indeed, from strictly a cost standpoint, retaining any employee is obviously vastly better than recruiting a replacement, and the study found that ERP participants were 8% more likely to be retained than other workers. 
Further, the research found that ERP participants were 7.5% more likely to be transferred. It’s somewhat more difficult to perceive how that translates to savings. But Karen Kocher, Cigna’s chief learning officer, notes that “transfers” include employees that retained their existing roles and also acquired new responsibilities as a result of their ERP participation. 
“Say there’s a data analytics project, and we’re a couple of people shy of having all the resources we need to drive it as quickly or significantly as we’d like,” says Kocher. “Now we can align that with the people who got or are pursuing data analytics degrees. They may not have all the on-the-job expertise that others do, but they’ve got enough knowledge to put some horsepower behind that project.” 
During the study period, approximately 2,200 of Cigna’s 31,000 U.S. employees took advantage of the tuition reimbursement program. The program is available to any employee with no performance-related issues. Knowledge Is Power 
There may be no magic to 129% as a precise savings figure, but according to Kocher, the knowledge that there’s a solid financial return could move the needle on additional investment in the program. 
“Instead of just setting aside the same amount of money every year for education reimbursement, thinking of it as a benefit we’re offering because our competitors offer it, [Cigna executives] now can look at whether we want to invest even more from a development and promotability perspective,” Kocher says. “There are a lot of things to invest a dollar in, but this one now stands out more than it did before.” 
For example, in response to the study results Cigna has increased the amount of reimbursement available for certain strategically significant educational degrees, certifications, and professional designations. 
For more general educational programs, the company still reimburses at or slightly below the IRS deductibility limits of $5,250 per year for undergraduate programs and $8,000 for graduate programs. 
But for the strategically more vital educational pursuits, Cigna has upped the ante to $10,000 and $12,000, respectively. Those include: Digital media production/digital marketing

 28 AM EDT Broadview Homes Takes Top Builder of the Year Award 
Calgary, Alberta - The Canadian Home Builders&apos; Association-Urban Development Institute Calgary Region Association’s SAM (Sales and Marketing) Awards on Saturday, April 16 at the Telus Convention Centre, named Broadview Homes as the Builder of the Year . 
“It’s over-the-moon excitement,” says Broadview Homes’ Vice-President, Peter-John Woolf about winning the Builder of the Year. 
The SAM Awards are handed out annually and highlight the top performances in home design, renovation, community development, sales and marketing. Entries to the SAM Award totaled over 830, and were said to be on par with last year’s record number of entries. A total of 127 companies also vied for 60 awards in different categories, including the top Grand SAMs – Builder of the Year. 
Besides taking the SAM 2015 Builder of the Year Award, Broadview Homes was also the proud recipients of the following awards: 
Best New Home $720K-$850K: Broadview Homes&apos; Hugo in Harmony. Best New Home $485K -$550K: Broadview Homes&apos; Stanford II in Kinniburgh, Chestermere. Best New Home - $325,000-$374,999: Broadview Homes for the Kornell. 
When asked about Broadview Homes’ designs, Peter-John said, “We’ll never lose sight of what the public has been buying but we’re constantly putting new things into it. We’ll constantly take chances.” 
Speaking further about the occasion, the Broadview Homes Vice-President, in a post-event interview spoke about the night at the gala. 
“Saturday night was extremely exciting for our staff, we knew we had some fantastic designs that we submitted, that we were really proud of. We were getting some good feedback from the public on our show homes, on the creativity and on the uniqueness. …And because we had concentrated so much on the houses we did submit, we didn’t get any finalists in other categories so I assumed the best we could do was win maybe some awards for our designs. [During the evening,] as we won a bunch of awards for the designs, we were super ecstatic, and we thought our night was over and we were all so happy with our accomplishment. …When they mentioned the category of builder of the year, everybody’s mouth dropped. …And so to win it, you can just imagine,” said an overwhelmed Woolf. 
He also spoke glowingly about the support from Qualico, their staff and trader partners. The following is what he had to say: 
“I’d like to recognize Qualico and also our trade partners, without whom, these houses wouldn’t just magically appear, and our houses wouldn’t be what they are without them. Our staff who are like my second family. I can honestly say I love working with these people, and I feel blessed to do it every day.”

What about looking at the Crown Estate and how it affects people&apos;s rights? It seems to be a kind of island apart from normal democracy.
Is not the City of London Corporation another case in point?
And what&apos;s the story behind the Tory \&quot;Northern Powerhouse\&quot; scheme, where powerful mayors will leapfrog the political controls found in the rest of the country.
And selective council privatising of public services, a look at one of the counties that have put their services (social, youth etc.) out to tender to people like Branson?
What these points have in common is what looks like the increase of various types of \&quot;gated cities\&quot; of privilege and dilution of public control in the UK.

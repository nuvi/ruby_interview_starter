Farrell: Josh Rutledge &apos;became a different hitter&apos; since Red Sox acquired him Jason Mastrodonato Sunday, April 24, 2016 Credit: Associated Press Josh Rutledge comments Tweet HOUSTON -- If Red Sox hitting coach Chili Davis and assistant chili coach Victor Rodriguez really fixed Josh Rutledge’s swing, it’s a good thing he cleared waivers.
The Red Sox might have themselves another utility man.
Since being acquired from the Los Angeles Angels in the trade for Shane Victorino late last year, Rutledge is quietly hitting .304 with a .741 OPS in 90 plate appearances with the Sox.
“I felt like especially last year, after I got traded, working with Chili and Vic over here I feel like I’ve really found something,” the 27-year-old Rutledge said. “I feel a lot more comfortable in the box as far as my stance and keeping my swing where it needs to be every day following a routine. That’s really helped. They’ve done a good job helping me stay there.”
He’s 3-for-5 with three doubles this year, including two doubles in pinch-hitting appearances.
He came off the bench to hit for Chris Young against a right-handed pitcher in the eighth inning on Saturday and smoked an RBI double down the left-field line.
Rutledge, who hit .259 with a .711 OPS in parts of three seasons as the shortstop for the Colorado Rockies, said he’s become comfortable coming off the bench, a key point the Red Sox will have to consider if and when Pablo Sandoval is ready to come back from the 15-day disabled list.
“I think a lot of it has to do with starting in the National League,” Rutledge said. “That’s the same way as far as at-bats go. If you’re not really playing every day, there’s a chance you’re going to get to pinch-hit at some time in that game. Over the years I feel like I’ve kind of gotten a better mindset on how to attack those at-bats and how to get ready for them. I think that’s really helped.”
Designated for assignment on Nov. 30, Rutledge could’ve been claimed by any other team.
Nobody took a chance on him and the Sox stashed him in Triple-A Pawtucket. When Sandoval got hurt, Rutledge joined the Red Sox. He&apos;s trying to carve out a role as an extra utility man along with Brock Holt, who has been starting most games in left field.
Rutledge plays shortstop, second base, third base and recently began taking grounders at first base.
But his offensive ability might be his most valuable asset.
“To come off the bench, where you haven&apos;t been in the flow of the game, and address mid-90s, it&apos;s a very direct swing,” manager John Farrell said. “When you think about what he did when he first came over in the trade last year, the work he&apos;s done with Chili, there&apos;s been an adjustment with his hands. The final 3-4 weeks of last season he became a different hitter. That&apos;s continued through spring training and now.”

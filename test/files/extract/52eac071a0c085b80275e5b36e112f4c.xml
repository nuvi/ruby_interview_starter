guide Learn all the important parts of your journey without spoiling the experience. 
Dark Souls 3 is a very in-depth game with a lot of hidden areas to explore, and a lot of hidden items to obtain. While this can be extremely fun to explore on your own, it can also lead to you missing out on entire areas of the game, if you aren’t careful. Unlike our full walkthroughs, this guide won’t show you where to find the items, how to beat the bosses, or when you should roll or block. This guide will, however, showcase the game’s critical path, that way you can easily follow along without spoiling the story for yourself. 
It should be noted that there will be light spoilers throughout this guide, as we will list the names of the areas that you need to visit, as well as the NPCs you need to interact with. However, this is the extent of these spoilers. If you wish to view more in-depth guides, please take a look at our complete Dark Souls 3 guide for more details about items, NPCs, and more. 
In order to make this guide easy to follow we have marked Optional Bosses a [OB], and Mandatory Bosses as [MB]. Entries markes [R] are required steps, and are the mandatory steps you must complete to progress the game. Cemetery of Ash

Irving scores 31, has key late 3 in 100-98 victory BY DAVID BRIGGSBLADE SPORTS WRITER 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. — Summer in the Motor City arrived early Sunday night. 
With the Cavaliers appearing fit for a run deep into the spring, Cleveland made short work of the Detroit Pistons’ first playoff appearance in seven years in a 100-98 win at The Palace. 
Delighting their fans and Beliebers alike — a Game 5 at Quicken Loans Arena on Tuesday would have postponed a Justin Bieber concert — Kyrie Irving and the Cavaliers completed the first-round sweep with a thrilling final sequence. 
Irving hit a contested 3-pointer from the wing with 42 seconds left that put the Cavaliers ahead 100-96 — his biggest shot on a night filled with them — then Cleveland desperately held on. 
Detroit’s Reggie Jackson followed with a dunk, and after Irving badly missed a baseline jumper, the Pistons had 10 seconds to race up the floor to tie or win the game. But Jackson’s running shot from just beyond the 3-point line at the buzzer missed wide, leaving Jackson screaming for a foul and the Cavaliers streaming joyously onto the court. 
Irving, tormenting the Pistons with his pirouetting drives and four 3s — including a half-court shot at the end of the third quarter — continued his tour-de-force series with 31 points. LeBron James had 22 points, 11 rebounds, and six assists, while J.R. Smith added 15 points on five 3s. 
Cleveland now awaits the winner of the Atlanta-Boston series. 
It was the 17th straight first-round win by a James-led team and the Cavaliers’ 12th consecutive playoff win over Detroit — matching an NBA record for postseason victories over a single team. The Lakers beat the SuperSonics 12 straight times from 1980-89. 
Fans could have saved their money on the finale of this mini series. 
The games played out on loop, with the Pistons displaying early spirit before Cleveland’s overload of talent and experience prevailed. 
Sunday was no different. A Detroit franchise that lost 157 games over the last three seasons before winning 44 this year with one of the league’s youngest rosters foreshadowed good times ahead. 
It was all there on display in the first half: The shooting of Marcus Morris (18 points, 3 of 3 from beyond the arc). The slashing of Reggie Jackson (seven points, six assists). The inside play of All-Star center Andre Drummond (10 points, six rebounds). 
Detroit opened a 12-3 lead as Cleveland missed six of its first seven shots and held its own for more than three quarters. The Cavaliers couldn’t shake their hosts. 
When Irving burst for 10 points in 79 seconds to give Cleveland a 67-56 lead early in the third quarter, Detroit answered to tie the game at 74. When Irving’s half-court shot at the end of the third quarter touched off an 8-0 run that pushed the Cavs ahead 86-78, the Pistons answered — a driving score by Reggie Jackson cut their deficit to one at 86-85. When Smith beat the shot clock with a seeming dagger 3 from the wing that put the Cavs ahead 95-86, the Pistons answered. A 3 by Kentavious Caldwell-Pope again cut their deficit to one at 97-96 with 1:07 left. 
Morris finished with 24 points. Tobias Harris added 23. 
DRUMMOND CLEARED: The NBA opted not to discipline Drummond for his blindside elbow to James’ head in Game 3. 
“Initially, I was surprised,” James said Sunday, “but then I thought about who he did it to, and I wasn’t surprised.” 
The implication was clear: James does not think he receives a fair shake from officials. Neither does Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue, who was reminded of how his former teammate, Shaquille O’Neal, was treated. 
“He’s the Shaq of guards and forwards,” Lue said. “He’s so strong and so physical that when he goes to the basket, guys are bouncing off of him. Those are still fouls.”

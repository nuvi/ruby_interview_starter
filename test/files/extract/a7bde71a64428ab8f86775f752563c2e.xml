Defence aim to scupper extradition of alleged people-trafficker as Greek jail &apos;too harsh&apos; Defence aim to scupper extradition of alleged people-trafficker as Greek jail &apos;too harsh&apos; THE alleged head of a £7million people smuggling gang is to fight extradition because Greek jails are too harsh, a court heard yesterday. PUBLISHED: 19:39, Mon, Apr 25, 2016 | UPDATED: 19:56, Mon, Apr 25, 2016 SWNS/GETTY Accused Jamal Owda was arrested in a hostel in an asylum hostel in Liverpool 
Jamal Owda posed as an asylum seeker in Liverpool while his henchmen helped 50,000 migrants to swarm into Greece from Turkey, it is claimed. 
The Palestinian, who slipped into Britain in a lorry in 2014, was arrested in a Europe-wide clampdown on people trafficking in December. Related articles U2 star Bono claims Britain voting to leave EU would be UNTHINKABLE 
Owda, 26, was one of 23 suspects arrested during the raids – most of them in Greece, Westminster magistrates court heard. 
Officers from the National Crime Agency found £17,500 hidden in a speaker in his room at an asylum hostel. GETTY Owed is trying to avoid extradition by claiming Greek prisons are ‘too harsh’ 
The authorities in Athens want him extradited so he can stand trial for people-smuggling. 
He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. 
But his lawyer said yesterday that jail conditions in Greece are inhumane and a breach of his human rights. 
Amelia Nice told the central London court that the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture recently reported the state of Greek prisons is bad and getting “significantly worse”. 
Owda, who has mental health problems, also fears being deported back to Palestine if he is extradited, Ms Nice added. 
He is suspected of being the mastermind of a trafficking gang who arranged for 100 migrants to enter Greece from Turkey every day for 16 months. 
Most gang members were Greeks who were co-ordinated by an Albanian associate of Owda, police said. GETTY Officers found £17,500 hidden in a speaker in Owda’s room after a raid 
The network is said to have made £7million since 2013 by preying on innocent civilians desperate to flee the war-torn Middle East. I think you have to get on and prepare this case Elizabeth Roscoe, District Judge 
They smuggled them through Greece and the Balkans into other European countries including Germany, France and Britain. 
Yesterday, Owda briefly appeared in court via video link from Wandsworth prison, south London. 
He spoke through an Arabic interpreter. 
District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe adjourned the hearing until May 10, but said the case could be delayed by Owda’s asylum claim. GETTY Evidence of conditions in Greek jails and Owda’s mental state will be heard next month 
She told Ms Nice: “I understand that you may be raising similar issues as are being raised in the asylum claim. 
“But what has been raised in the asylum claim is surely a matter between Mr Owda and the Home Office. They process the asylum claim. 
“I think you have to get on and prepare this case. It may be that it cannot be heard if the asylum decision has not been reached.” 
Evidence of conditions in Greek jails and Owda’s mental state will be heard at the hearing next month. Related articles

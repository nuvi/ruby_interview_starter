Keenan House residents helpful in Allentown cleanup This reminds one of the seven loaves and fishes story 
Twenty-five people came out for the 11th annual Library Area Neighborhood (Allentown) Clean Up on April 16. 
Breaking into teams we cleaned Linden to Fairview streets, from 12th to 14th, including the many alleys. We left many bags of trash and recycling the city recycling crew was quick and efficient in picking up. 
Afterward the Keenan House friends and many of us enjoyed a pleasant luncheon at Lehigh Valley Presbyterian Church. Someone asked Keenan House residents, who are undergoing an intensive drug treatment program, if they were forced to take part. The residents said that the day the cleanup notice was listed at Keenan House, volunteers immediately filled the list, and all nine came. I was glad that we took time and opportunity to share with them. 
These events remind me of the seven loaves and fishes story from the Bible. I always wonder if there will be enough people to get the job done, and enough food afterward to say thanks. &quot;And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and broke them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude, and gave thanks.&quot;

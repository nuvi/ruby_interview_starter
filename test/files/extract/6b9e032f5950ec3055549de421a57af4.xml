 18 AM EDT Liquid Crystal on Silicon Market 2016-2020 Industry exmined by Syndicate Market Research 
Liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) is a reflective active-matrix liquid-crystal display. It is commonly called as microdisplay technology using a liquid crystal layer on top of a silicon pixel controller backplane. It is also referred as a spatial light modulator. Liquid Crystal on Silicon was initially developed for the use of projection in televisions. But now, it is used for wide range of application such as near eye displays, structured illumination, optical pulse shaping and wavelength selective switching. LCoS is typically used in a number of industries like consumer electronics, entertainment, medical, military and defense, automation and others. Moreover, some advantages of LCoS microdisplay technology include high brightness, high efficiency, contrast, resolution and others. Three-panel and single-panel are the two main categories of Liquid crystal on silicon. 
Rising global focus on new technology superiority is a key driving factor of the liquid crystal on silicon market. Open technology platform, compatibility with a wide range of products are the another key factor for liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) market. The rising demand for high resolution display is boost the growth of the global LCoS market. Additionally, consumer goods are the leading and fastest growing segment in this market. LCoS panel are increasingly use in head-mounted display (HMD) and head-up display (HUD). High cast in competing technologies is major restraints for Liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) market.

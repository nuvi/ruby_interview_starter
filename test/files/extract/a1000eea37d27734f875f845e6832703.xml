When we first heard from MODERN Instagram follower Virginia Finley ( @thehairdoctor101 ) about her creative-coloring application she created for her teacher client, we knew it had to be shared. Finley, who works at Poshe Salon in Belford, New Jersey, created this peek-a-boo hue to let her client express her individuality in a way that was a bit toned down for the school she works at—allowing her to hide the fashion colors when neeeded. 
To begin, Finley sliced out a section from ear to ear, then angled foils from the ear to the middle of the head on each side, leaving an almost-triangle section in the middle, combined with 40-volume developer and Olaplex. 
Next, Finley did a global application of Pravana 4n and 10-volume for depositing purposes only, processing for 40 minutes. 
After rinsing, conditioning and drying, she sliced the rainbox colors on an angle in the same way, using Pravana Yellow, Blue and Purple. She also added slices of Rusk Pink, Red, Orange and Teal. After processing for 40 minutes, she created a blunt cut and gave her angles in the front. Video of tt8aBBzmKuQ

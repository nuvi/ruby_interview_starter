Cruz and Kasich alliance &quot;pathetic&quot;: Trump Author Tuesday, 26 April 2016, 6:38AM Trump is calling Cruz&apos;s alliance with John Kaisch &quot;pathetic&quot;. (File). 
Donald Trump remains defiant in the face of a Republican alliance aimed to knock him from the Republican presidential nomination. 
Ted Cruz and John Kasich will divide their efforts in upcoming contests, with Cruz focusing on Indiana and Kasich devoting his efforts to Oregon and New Mexico. 
Trump&apos;s called the alliance pathetic. 
He said it&apos;s a desperate measure particularly for John Kasich. 
&quot;He&apos;s won one race in 41 states, one! So I have a new nickname for him, one for 41. Very soon it&apos;s going to be one for 46 or 7.&quot; 
The strategy is aimed at blocking Trump from gaining the 1200 and 37 delegates necessary to claim to GOP nomination this summer. 
Trump&apos;s national spokeswoman Katrina Pierson said: &quot;This is two desperate campaigns who can not win on their own. They are two institutionalised candidates, who have never had a clear messages, and the voters are rejecting them.&quot; Related Articles

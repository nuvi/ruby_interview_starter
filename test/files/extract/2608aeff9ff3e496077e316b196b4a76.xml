Maisie Williams, Delightful Person, Crashes Fans&apos; Game of Thrones Viewing Party Comment Posted Apr. 25, 2016 at 1:53 PM Updated at 4:01 PM Posted Apr 25, 2016 at 1:53 PM Updated at 4:01 PM We&apos;ve known for a long time that Maisie Williams , who plays Arya Stark on Game of Thrones , is really good at social media. But Sunday (April 24) night during the Game of Thrones Season 6 premiere, she took her viral content game up a whole &apos;nother level by documenting her adventure crashing a local Game of Thrones fan&apos;s viewing party. The saga began when she asked on Twitter if there were any UCLA students having a viewing party; and after finding out the address, she picked up some snacks and went over. The people at the party just thought they were getting some free Game of Thrones swag, but to their surprise the swag happened to be Arya Stark herself! It&apos;s good she was a solid surprise on her own, because Williams&apos; supermarket snacks couldn&apos;t hold a candle to the students&apos; Game of Thrones -inspired menu. I mean, Grey Worm&apos;s Worms? That&apos;s pretty clever. We&apos;ll turn it over to Maisie Williams to tell the story from here: (1/12) This commences my photo story. Earlier today I put this out to everyone on Twitter... I wanted to find some unsuspecting fans and surprise them with drinks and snacks before the premiere episode tonight...

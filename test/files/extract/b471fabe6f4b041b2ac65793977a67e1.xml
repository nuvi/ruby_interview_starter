PRATTVILLE For the selection committee it was a no brainer. 
The 13-member panel unanimously selected Cori Trotter from among seven candidates to receive the first Sports and Beyond Award. The Prattville High School senior is a standout outfielder on the school’s baseball team, but the award is for what he does away from the field, said Jamie Cromblin, founder of Beyond Sports. The selection committee was made up of three Beyond Sports staffers and a panel of 10 people from the community. 
“We had some very good resumes from student athletes from the River Region,”Cromblin said. “All the candidates were very well qualified, but Cori was above and beyond everyone else. At first it surprised us that we had a unanimous choice. 
“But when you look back on it, everywhere you look with Cori, there is something good going on.” 
Beyond Sports is a faith-based organization serving the River Region that recognizes good character and furthers its development. 
For one so young, Trotter has paid his civic rent. The 18-year-old is a member of Passion Church where he serves with the church’s children’s ministry, working on the acting and dance teams. He’s president of Prattville Pals, an organization at PHS that helps special needs students. He escorted a special needs student to the prom last Saturday night. He has passed on his skills on the diamond by serving as a volunteer at area baseball camps. And he often hangs out with younger children at the park helping teach proper throwing and hitting techniques. And his vocation doesn’t stray far from his avocation, he works as a bat boy for the Montgomery Biscuits. 
“I think it’s great for Cori and great for Prattville High,” said Joseph Colvin, PHS head baseball coach, said of the award. “Cori’s been a member of Pals since 9th grade. So it’s not like he decided to do all these good things his senior year. Cori is a fine player. But he’s a ‘Yes sir, no sir’ kind of kid. He watches out for the younger students. 
“He’s not any trouble. I never have a teacher come to me saying ‘Coach, Cori is doing this.’ Or “Coach, Cori is not doing this.’ All around he’s just a good kid.” 
It’s always been that way, said Tiffany Washington, Cori’s mom. 
“Even as a little boy, Cori has had a heart for others,” she said. “When he was in pre-school, there was a little girl who couldn’t bring a snack to school. Cori shared his snack with her. When the teacher told me that he shared his snack with this little girl every day, I started packing two snacks.” 
For his part, Trotter seems your typical teen, complete with funny haircut. At a recent practice, the team was prepping for wrapping up the regular season. Trotter was laughing and joking as the team went through stretching and hitting drills. 
When a Montgomery Advertiser motioned him over for an interview, he was all business. 
“Yes sir, we can go in the locker room so we won’t be distracted,” he said. “Coach knows you have me, right?” 
So what does the award mean? 
“I really like it,” he said. “It shows that people look at me in different ways than just in sports and in school,” he said. And he doesn’t see himself as a role model. “I feel bad when I see people doing crazy things. And I feel that if I join in with that I’ll get in some kind of trouble. So I try to look out for other people and help them.” 
Trotter’s life serves as an example for all ages, said Floyd Upshaw, program director for Beyond Sports. 
“We started this organization to reach out to kids who are living their lives in a positive manner and who are reaching out to others,” Upshaw said. “As a man of God, I love the way Cori works as a Christian child. Here’s a young man that’s only 18-years-old and he’s humbled himself to serve others. 
“He has the skills on the field, and he has the grades. But the way he lives his life, in service to others, that’s what impresses me most about Cori.” 
So with graduation approaching, what next? Trotter plans on traveling to Australia to play baseball. His late uncle, Allen McCowan, played in a basketball league Down Under. 
“It’ll give me the opportunity to play against different competition and improve my game,” he said. “It’ll also give me the opportunity to travel and see other cultures and what it’s like in other countries.” 
Not shirking his education, he plans on taking college courses on line. 
So what does Mom think about her oldest son traveling half-way around the world? 
“I’m a peace with it,” she said with a quick laugh. “His aunt is in Australia so he will have family there. She’ll be about three hours away. Cori came to me several weeks ago and said that he had a plan. 
“Cori never does anything unless he has a plan. He’s made the right decisions so far. This will give him the opportunity to travel when he’s young. He may not have those opportunities in a few years.” CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/26p5pmm TOP VIDEOS

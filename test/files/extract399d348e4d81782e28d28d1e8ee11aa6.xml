GameXplain Tackles the Zelda Voice Acting Debate — Should Characters Speak? Posted on April 25 2016 by Henry Nossiter 
The early days of voice acting in games were terrible, complete trash. I think we can all agree on that. It was weird, silly, and unnatural sounding. Even today, there are triple-A games with awkward sounding voices parading about. Nevertheless, since 3D was brought to the Zelda series, the debate has raged on about whether real voices should be brought to the Zelda games. The closest we ever got was Midna in Twilight Princess , and she spoke a bunch of gibberish that we suppose passes for Hylian (it was actually just scrambled English). Link, Zelda, Ganon, and the rest of the gang only ever communicate in text, or strange grunts and laughs. Link&apos;s various noises in Ocarina of Time bug me in particular. A half hour in and it&apos;s already grating on my ears. 
This week, GameXplain sets out to try and answer this question. The consensus among them seems to be that, if done correctly, Zelda games could really gain from voice acting, citing the epic cut scenes in some of the recent Zeldas could be beneficial. On the other hand, we have that big &quot;if done correctly.&quot; Zelda games are published in many different countries, in many different languages. The Japanese and English dubs could sound fine, but some other language will probably end up getting a dub akin to the first Resident Evil. Anyway, what do you guys think of Zelda with voices? Be sure to check out GameXplain&apos;s channel, and let us know in the comments.

Beyonce fans zero in on Rachel Roy after &apos;Lemonade&apos; release Antoinette Bueno , wsts2 9:21   CONNECT   
To say Rachel Roy is catching plenty of heat from the Beyhive is an understatement. 
Beyonce&apos;s hour-long HBO special, Lemonade , aired on Saturday night, and it featured themes of infidelity which left fans speculating about marital issues between her and Jay Z -- especially when they zeroed in on a cryptic lyric from her song &quot;Sorry.&quot; 
&quot;Better call Becky with the good hair,&quot; Beyonce sings. 
PICS: Bigggest Celebrity Cheating Scandals 
As Twitter blew up with speculation on who &quot;Becky&quot; could be, Roy posted a curious Instagram message on Saturday night, which some took as evidence that the 42-year-old designer might be the woman being referenced. 
&quot;Good hair don&apos;t care, but we will take good lighting for selfies, or self truths, always. Live in the light. #nodramaqueens,&quot; Roy captioned a smiling pic with her and a friend, which she later deleted. Presumably because of online harassment -- including someone editing Roy&apos;s Wikipedia pag e to read &quot;Becky with the good hair&quot; -- Roy later made her Instagram private and seemed to address the scandal on Sunday morning. I respect love, marriages, families and strength. What shouldn&apos;t be tolerated by anyone, no matter what, is bullying, of any kind. — Rachel Roy (@Rachel_Roy) April 24, 2016 
This isn&apos;t the first time that fans have speculated about Roy&apos;s relationship with Jay Z. Rumors came to a head in May 2014, when it was reported that Beyonce&apos;s sister Solange&apos;s infamous elevator attack on her brother-in-law came after Solange had a heated confrontation with Roy at a Met Gala afterparty. 
Roy was previously married to Jay Z&apos;s former business partner and friend, Damon Dash, before she filed for divorce in 2009 after four years of marriage. 
Entertainment Tonight has reached out to Roy&apos;s rep.

In August 2014, Beyonce&apos;s dad, Mathew Knowles, implied that the entire elevator incident was a setup to drum up promotion for Bey and Jay&apos;s &quot;On the Run&quot; tour. 
&quot;[They needed something to] ignite that tour. It&apos;s called a Jedi mind trick,&quot; Knowles told Houston&apos;s Roula and Ryan Show on 104.1 KRBE. &quot;A Jedi mind trick fools you a lot of times. All I know is everyone is talking about it. Ticket sales went up, Solange&apos;s album sales went up 200 percent...&quot;

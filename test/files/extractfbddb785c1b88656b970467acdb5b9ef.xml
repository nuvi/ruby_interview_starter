50,000th electric Zoe hits the road 50,000th electric Zoe hits the road 
Renault announced that it has achieved an important milestone with its electric city car Zoe: number 50,000 rolled off the assembly line last Friday, nearly four years after it was introduced. 
The Zoe is especially popular in France, where it holds a market share of 55%. Last year, 18,500 units were sold in total and the European market is still growing rapidly. Compared to 2014, global EV sales grew by 48% last year in Europe and Renault expects 2016 to yield even better results. 
Apart from the 5 door city car Zoe, Renault’s Z.E. (for zero emissions) line-up consists of the Twizy, an urban two-seater, the Kangoo Z.E., a small commercial vehicle, and the Kangoo Z.E. Maxi, its elongated sibling.

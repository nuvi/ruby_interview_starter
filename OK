Some of Donald Trump’s toughest GOP critics in the Senate are pressuring the presumptive Republican nominee to reveal more information about the type of justices he would nominate for the Supreme Court — and force the mercurial candidate to bolster his conservative bona fides. As the protracted political battle over Merrick Garland’s nomination shows no signs of letting up, Democrats are increasingly invoking Trump and questioning whether GOP senators are comfortable with allowing the billionaire business mogul to make lifetime Supreme Court appointments.
But key Senate Republicans say they, too, have questions about whom Trump would select to the nation’s highest court, and are urging him to offer more details.
“We’re going to decide at some point what we do with Garland,” said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who doesn’t support moving on Garland’s nomination before November yet has strong reservations about Trump as his party’s nominee. “It would help to feel better about where Trump is going.”
Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of the most influential Republicans refusing to support Trump, argued that Trump’s pick would be “no worse than that” of likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton but added: “I know Clinton’s gonna pick a liberal. I have no idea who Trump would pick.”
“I think it’d probably help him,” Graham, a Judiciary Committee member, said of Trump releasing more information about whom he would nominate to the Supreme Court.
Still, the prospect of Trump as the all-but-official GOP standard-bearer has done little to move Senate Republicans off their no-hearings-no-vote stance on Garland, even though the conference remains deeply fractured over whether they can all even get behind Trump as the nominee.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), through a spokesman, has already indicated that having Trump at the top of the Republican ticket would not change his mind on blocking Garland for the rest of the year. And despite his vocal distaste for Trump, Graham dismissed any notion that he would change his mind about holding off on Garland, arguing that the “history of the Senate is to not confirm somebody in this situation.”
Flake has been openly advocating for a lame-duck confirmation for weeks, particularly if Democrats win the White House in November. On NBC’s “Meet the Press” this week, Flake added that the Senate should move on Garland if it appears as if “we’re going to lose the election.”
“I may be willing to roll the dice,” Flake told reporters on Tuesday. “We ought to have a conservative jurist replace [the late Justice Antonin] Scalia. I think most of us believe that Trump would still appoint somebody more conservative than Hillary Clinton would, but I’d like to know more. I’d like to be more sure of that.”
Steve Daines of Montana is another Senate Republican who has been reluctant to fully endorse Trump despite the businessman’s decisive victory in Indiana last week and the suspension of the campaigns of all other Republican presidential candidates. He has also joined all but two Senate Republicans in insisting that Scalia’s seat remain vacant until the new president can choose a replacement.
Yet, Daines said he doesn’t have any trepidation about Trump’s potential Supreme Court nominations.
“The principle here is, we’re going to let the people vote and let them decide,” Daines said. But he also called on Trump to show leadership by uniting the party, and said part of demonstrating leadership in Trump’s case is about showing whom he would pick for vice president, his administration and the Supreme Court.
Trump has given some clues about whom he might nominate to the high court. In a February debate, the business mogul dropped the names of William Pryor, who serves on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and 7th Circuit Judge Diane Sykes. Both are conservatives who were nominated by President George W. Bush.

The presumptive nominee said in March that the conservative Heritage Foundation is helping him draft a list of 10 potential Supreme Court nominees, but those names haven’t yet materialized. A Trump campaign spokeswoman did not respond to an email Tuesday asking for an update on when those names would be made public.
But Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the first senator to endorse Trump, said he expects the campaign to release more information about whom Trump would nominate. And Sessions was confident his colleagues, even the skeptical ones, would be assured by Trump’s eventual picks.
“He’s already named two judges … who are universally recognized as stars of the kind that traditional judicial thinkers favor,” Sessions said, referring to Pryor and Sykes. “I don’t like to say conservative. We’re really talking about orthodoxy and judicial interpretations.”
Meanwhile, the pro-Garland campaign showed no signs of easing Tuesday on Capitol Hill. The White House formally submitted a lengthy questionnaire from the veteran jurist that’s a typical component of a Supreme Court nomination. For Senate Democrats, it was another chance to tout Garland’s credentials and hammer Republicans for their inaction on the court vacancy.
Standing in front of six boxes containing Garland’s questionnaire — a 141-page document and more than 2,000 pages of related appendices — Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee took turns praising Garland’s credentials and chastising Republicans in a continuation of their public-relations campaign that seems unlikelier by the day to produce a confirmation hearing and votes for Garland.
Later Tuesday, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the presumed next Senate majority leader if Democrats win control of the chamber in November, left the door open to considering a more liberal nominee than Garland in 2017 if Clinton wins the White House. Democratic senators would be pleased if Clinton kept Garland, and would give “due consideration” if she decided to go with someone else, Schumer said.
But mostly, Schumer and other Democrats sought repeatedly to tie Senate Republicans’ Garland blockade to their controversial presumed presidential nominee.
“On the one hand, Republicans are trying to wriggle out of their Trump straitjacket they find themselves in. But on the other, they’re doing everything they can to allow Mr. Trump to pick the next Supreme Court justice, one of the most important decisions a president can make,” Schumer said. “Those two positions just don’t square.”
The questionnaire did not appear to reveal anything particularly surprising about Garland, who has served on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals since 1997 and is currently the chief judge there. It provides a lengthy list of his public statements, legal opinions and other information senators generally review when evaluating Supreme Court nominees.

“With more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history and a long record of public service, we expect the Senate will give Chief Judge Garland the same fair consideration as prior nominees,” White House Counsel Neil Eggleston wrote in a blog item accompanying the questionnaire release. “The American people and the integrity of our judicial system deserve nothing less.”
Yet Senate Republicans were looking beyond Garland. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said he has “qualms no matter who’s president” about the makeup of the Supreme Court, but signaled that he would be confident Trump would choose nominees the longtime senator would find satisfactory.
“I don’t know of Trump’s nominees,” Hatch said. “But I can guarantee you that if he’s president of the United States, we’ll weigh in with him and make sure they’re good people.”
Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas added: “If we have a Republican Senate, I have no concerns” about whom a President Trump would pick for the high court.
“That’s why it’s so important from my perspective to maintain the Senate majority,” Cornyn said. “The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is an important figure in that, as well as the majority leader. That will provoke a conversation and a negotiation.”
